        <h1>Collision Domains</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In hub-based Ethernet segments, network devices compete for the medium, because devices must take turns when transmitting. The network segments that share the same bandwidth between devices are known as collision domains. When two or more devices within that the same collision domain try to communicate at the same time, a collision will occur.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If an Ethernet switch port is operating in half duplex, each segment is in its own collision domain. However, Ethernet switch ports operating in full duplex eliminate collisions; therefore, there is no collision domain.  By default, Ethernet switch ports will autonegotiate full duplex when the adjacent device can also operate in full duplex. If the switch port is connected to a device operating in half-duplex, such as a legacy hub, then the switch port will operate in half duplex. In the case of half duplex, the switch port will be part of a collision domain.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in the figure, full-duplex is chosen if both devices have the capability along with their highest common bandwidth.</p>
