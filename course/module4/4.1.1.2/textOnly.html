          <p>To support collaboration, business networks employ converged solutions using voice systems, IP phones, voice gateways, video support, and video conferencing, as shown in the figure. Including data services, a converged network with collaboration support may include the following features:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Call control</b> - Telephone call processing, caller ID, call transfer, hold, and conference</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Voice messaging</b> - Voicemail </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Mobility</b> - Receive important calls wherever you are </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Automated attendant</b> - Serve customers faster by routing calls directly to the right department or individual</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>One of the primary benefits of transitioning to the converged network is that there is just one physical network to install and manage. This results in substantial savings over the installation and management of separate voice, video, and data networks. Such a converged network solution integrates IT management so that any moves, additions, and changes are completed with an intuitive management interface. A converged network solution also provides PC softphone application support, as well as point-to-point video, so that users can enjoy personal communications with the same ease of administration and use as a voice call. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The convergence of services onto the network has resulted in an evolution in networks from a traditional data transport role, to a super-highway for data, voice, and video communication. This one physical network must be properly designed and implemented to allow the reliable handling of the various types of information that it must carry. A structured design is required to allow management of this complex environment.</p>
