        <h1>Hierarchy in the Borderless Switched Network</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Creating a borderless switched network requires that sound network design principles are used to ensure maximum availability, flexibility, security, and manageability. The borderless switched network must deliver on current requirements and future required services and technologies. Borderless switched network design guidelines are built upon the following principles:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Hierarchical</b> - Facilitates understanding the role of each device at every tier, simplifies deployment, operation, and management, and reduces fault domains at every tier</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Modularity </b>- Allows seamless network expansion and integrated service enablement on an on-demand basis</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Resiliency </b>- Satisfies user expectations for keeping the network always on</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Flexibility </b>- Allows intelligent traffic load sharing by using all network resources</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>These are not independent principles. Understanding how each principle fits in the context of the others is critical. Designing a borderless switched network in a hierarchical fashion creates a foundation that allows network designers to overlay security, mobility, and unified communication features. Two time-tested and proven hierarchical design frameworks for campus networks are the three-tier layer and the two-tier layer models, as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The three critical layers within these tiered designs are the access, distribution, and core layers. Each layer can be seen as a well-defined, structured module with specific roles and functions in the campus network. Introducing modularity into the campus hierarchical design further ensures that the campus network remains resilient and flexible enough to provide critical network services. Modularity also helps to allow for growth and changes that occur over time.</p>
