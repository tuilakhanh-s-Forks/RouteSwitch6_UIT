          <p>The role of switched networks has evolved dramatically in the last two decades. It was not long ago that flat Layer 2 switched networks were the norm. Flat Layer 2 switched networks relied on the Ethernet and the widespread use of hub repeaters to propagate LAN traffic throughout an organization. As shown in Figure 1, networks have fundamentally changed to switched LANs in a hierarchical network. A switched LAN allows more flexibility, traffic management, and additional features: </p>
