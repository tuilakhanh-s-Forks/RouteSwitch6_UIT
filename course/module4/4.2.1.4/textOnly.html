          <p>Store-and-forward switching has two primary characteristics that distinguish it from cut-through: error checking and automatic buffering.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Error Checking</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A switch using store-and-forward switching performs an error check on an incoming frame. After receiving the entire frame on the ingress port, as shown in the figure, the switch compares the frame-check-sequence (FCS) value in the last field of the datagram against its own FCS calculations. The FCS is an error checking process that helps to ensure that the frame is free of physical and data-link errors. If the frame is error-free, the switch forwards the frame. Otherwise the frame is dropped.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Automatic Buffering</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The ingress port buffering process used by store-and-forward switches provides the flexibility to support any mix of Ethernet speeds. For example, handling an incoming frame traveling into a 100 Mb/s Ethernet port that must be sent out a 1 Gb/s interface would require using the store-and-forward method. With any mismatch in speeds between the ingress and egress ports, the switch stores the entire frame in a buffer, computes the FCS check, forwards it to the egress port buffer and then sends it.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Store-and-forward switching is Ciscoâ€™s primary LAN switching method.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A store-and-forward switch drops frames that do not pass the FCS check; therefore, it does not forward invalid frames. By contrast, a cut-through switch may forward invalid frames because no FCS check is performed.</p>
