          <p>Use Packet Tracer for this activity. Internet connectivity is not required. Work with a classmate to create two network designs to accommodate the following scenarios:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Scenario 1 – Classroom Design (LAN)</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>15 student end devices represented by 1 or 2 PCs</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>1 instructor end device preferably represented by a server</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Stream video presentations over LAN connection </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Scenario 2 – Administrative Design (WAN)</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>All requirements as listed in Scenario 1</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Access to and from a remote administrative server for video presentations and pushed updates for network application software</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Both the LAN and WAN designs should fit on one Packet Tracer file screen. All intermediary devices should be labeled with the switch model (or name) and the router model (or name).  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Save your work and be ready to justify your device decisions and layout to your instructor and to the class.</p>
