          <p>When a port is configured with port security, a violation can cause the port to become error disabled. When a port is error disabled, it is effectively shut down and no traffic is sent or received on that port. A series of port security related messages display on the console (Figure 1). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The port protocol and link status is changed to down.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The port LED will turn off. The<b> show interfaces </b>command identifies the port status as<b> err-disabled </b>(Figure 2). The output of the<b> show port-security interface </b>command now shows the port status as<b> secure-shutdown</b>. Because the port security violation mode is set to shutdown, the port with the security violation goes to the error disabled state. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The administrator should determine what caused the security violation before re-enabling the port. If an unauthorized device is connected to a secure port, the port should not be re-enabled until the security threat is eliminated. To re-enable the port, use the<b> shutdown </b>interface configuration mode command (Figure 3). Then, use the<b> no shutdown </b>interface configuration command to make the port operational.</p>
