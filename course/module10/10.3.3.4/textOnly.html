          <p>To upgrade to the copied IOS image after that image is saved on the router's flash memory, configure the router to load the new image during bootup using the<b> boot system </b>command, as shown in Figure 1. Save the configuration. Reload the router to boot the router with new image. After the router has booted, to verify the new image has loaded, use the<b> show version </b>command, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>During startup, the bootstrap code parses the startup configuration file in NVRAM for the<b> boot system </b>commands that specify the name and location of the Cisco IOS Software image to load. Several<b> boot system </b>commands can be entered in sequence to provide a fault-tolerant boot plan. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If there are no<b> boot system </b>commands in the configuration, the router defaults to loading the first valid Cisco IOS image in flash memory and running it.</p>
