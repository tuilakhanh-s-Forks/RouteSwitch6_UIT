          <p>In this chapter, you will explore the tools network administrators can use for device discovery, device management, and device maintenance. Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) and Link Layer Discover Protocol (LLDP) are both capable of discovering information about directly connected devices. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Network Time Protocol (NTP) can be effectively used to synchronize the time across all your networking devices, which is especially important when trying to compare log files from different devices. Those log files are generated by the syslog protocol. Syslog messages can be captured and sent to a syslog server to aid in device management tasks. </p>

          <p>Device maintenance includes ensuring that Cisco IOS images and configuration files are backed up in a safe location in the event that the device memory is corrupted or erased, either maliciously or inadvertently. Maintenance also includes keeping the IOS image up to date. The device maintenance section of the chapter includes topics for file maintenance, image management, and software licensing.</p>
