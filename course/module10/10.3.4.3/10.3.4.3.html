        <h1>Step 1. Purchase the Software Package or Feature to Install</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The first step is to purchase the software package or feature needed. This may be adding a package to IP Base, such as Security.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Software Claim Certificates are used for licenses that require software activation. The claim certificate provides the Product Activation Key (PAK) for the license and important information regarding the Cisco End User License Agreement (EULA). In most instances, Cisco or the Cisco channel partner will have already activated the licenses ordered at the time of purchase and no Software Claim Certificate is provided. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In either instance, customers receive a PAK with their purchase. The PAK serves as a receipt and is used to obtain a license. A PAK is an 11 digit alpha numeric key created by Cisco manufacturing. It defines the Feature Set associated with the PAK. A PAK is not tied to a specific device until the license is created. A PAK can be purchased that generates any specified number of licenses. As shown in the figure, a separate license is required for each package, IP Base, Data, UC, and SEC. </p>
