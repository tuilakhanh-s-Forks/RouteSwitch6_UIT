          <p>This activity is designed to show how to restore a configuration from a backup and then perform a new backup. Due to an equipment failure, a new router has been put in place. Fortunately, backup configuration files have been saved to a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) Server. You are required to restore the files from the TFTP Server to get the router back online with as little downtime as possible.</p>
