          <p>Depending on the device, LLDP may be enabled by default. To enable LLDP globally on a Cisco network device, enter the <b>lldp run</b> command in the global configuration mode. To disable LLDP, enter the <b>no lldp run</b> command in the global configuration mode.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Similar to CDP, LLDP can be configured on specific interfaces. However, LLDP must be configured separately to transmit and receive LLDP packets, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To verify LLDP has been enabled on the device, enter the <b>show lldp</b> command in the privileged EXEC mode.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 2 to practice configuring and verifying LLDP.</p>
