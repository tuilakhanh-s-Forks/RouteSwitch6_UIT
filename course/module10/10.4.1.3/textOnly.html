          <p>In this chapter, you learned and practice skills that network administrators use for device discovery, management, and maintenance.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>CDP is a Cisco proprietary protocol for network discovery on the data link layer. It can share information such as device names and IOS versions, with other physically connected Cisco devices. LLDP is vendor-neutral protocol on the data link layer for network discovery.  The network devices advertise information, such as their identities and capabilities to their neighbors.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>NTP synchronizes the time of day among a set of distributed time servers and clients. This allows networking devices to agree on the time a specific event occurred, such as the lose of connectivity between a router and a switch. Syslog messages can be trapped and sent to a syslog server where the network administrator can investigate when the link failed.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Device maintenance includes the tasks of backing up, restoring, and upgrading IOS images and configuration files. Upgrading an IOS image also includes tasks related to software licensing.</p>
