          <p>The<b> license save </b>command is used to copy all licenses in a device and store them in a format required by the specified storage location. Saved licenses are restored by using the<b> license install </b>command.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The command to back up a copy of the licenses on a device is:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <span class="cmd">Router#</span>
            <span class="cmd">
              <b> license save </b>
            </span>
            <span class="cmd">
              <i>file-sys://lic-location</i>
            </span>
            <span class="cmd"></span>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the<b> show flash0: </b>command to verify that the licenses have been saved (Figure 1).</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The license storage location can be a directory or a URL that points to a file system. Use the<b> ? </b>command to see the storage locations supported by a device. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 2 to save all license files on router R2.</p>
