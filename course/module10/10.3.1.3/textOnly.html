            <b>Backup Configurations with Text Capture (Tera Term)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Configuration files can be saved/archived to a text file using Tera Term. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in the figure, the steps are:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1</b>. On the File menu, click <b>Log</b>.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2</b>. Choose the location to save the file. Tera Term will begin capturing text. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3</b>. After capture has been started, execute the <b>show running-config</b> or <b>show startup-config</b> command at the privileged EXEC prompt. Text displayed in the terminal window will be directed to the chosen file.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4</b>. When the capture is complete, select <b>Close</b> in the Tera Term: Log window.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5</b>. View the file to verify that it was not corrupted.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Restoring Text Configurations</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A configuration can be copied from a file to a device. When copied from a text file and pasted into a terminal window, the IOS executes each line of the configuration text as a command. This means that the file will require editing to ensure that encrypted passwords are in plain text and that non-command text such as "--More--" and IOS messages are removed. This process is discussed in the lab. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Further, at the CLI, the device must be set at the global configuration mode to receive the commands from the text file being pasted into the terminal window.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When using Tera Term, the steps are:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1</b>. On the File menu, click <b>Send</b> file.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2</b>. Locate the file to be copied into the device and click <b>Open</b>.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3</b>. Tera Term will paste the file into the device.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The text in the file will be applied as commands in the CLI and become the running configuration on the device. This is a convenient method for manually configuring a router.</p>
