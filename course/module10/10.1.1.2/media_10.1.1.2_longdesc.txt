Figure 1 uses the 'show cdp' command to display the default settings for CDP which are send CDP message every 60 seconds, holdtime of 180 seconds, and CDPv2 enabled. Figure 2 shows the 'cdp enable' command configured on the gigabitethernet 0/1 interface on a switch. In figure 3, CDP is globally disabled with the 'no cdp run' command. Then 'show cdp' verifies it is disabled. Finally, CDP is re-enabled globally. In Figure 4, the output of the 'show cdp neighbors' command shows that the router has no CDP neighbors. In Figure 5, output of the 'show cdp interface' command highlights that gigabitethernet 0/1 is up. All interfaces have CDP enabled.
