Router R1 is connected to the local fastethernet 0/5 interface and that switch S2 is connected to the local fastethernet 0/4 interface. Figure 2 shows a router R1 connected to switch S1, which is connected to another switch S2. Output from the 'show lldp neighbors detail' command highlights that the management IP address for router R1 is 192.168.1.1.
