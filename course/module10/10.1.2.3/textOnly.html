          <p>With LLDP enabled, device neighbors can be discovered using the <b>show lldp neighbors</b> command. For example, consider the lack of documentation in the topology shown in Figure 1. The network administrator only knows that S1 is connected to two devices. Using the <b>show lldp neighbors</b> command, the network administrator discovers that S1 has a router and a switch as a neighbors.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The letter B under capability for S2 represents a Bridge. For this output, the word bridge can also mean switch. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>From the results of <b>show lldp neighbors</b>, a topology from switch S1 can be constructed as depicted in Figure 2. When more details about the neighbors are needed, the <b>show lldp neighbors detail</b> command can provide information, such as the neighborsâ€™ IOS version, IP address, and device capability.</p>
