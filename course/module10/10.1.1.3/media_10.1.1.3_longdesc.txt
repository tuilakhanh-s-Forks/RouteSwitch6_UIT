Figure 1 shows a router connected to a cloud and the output fo the 'show cdp neighbors' command. Router R1 has one CDP neighbor, switch S1, which is attached to the local gigabitethernet0/0 interface. Figure 2 shows a router connected to a switch, which is connected to a cloud and the output of the 'show cdp neighbors detail' command. The IP address for switch S1 is 192.168.1.2 and it is running IOS version 15.0. Figure 3 shows the same topology with the output of the 'show cdp neighbors' command on switch S1. Switch S1 is connected to two devices. Router R1 is connected the local fastethernet0/5 interface. Switch S2 is connected to the local fastethernet0/4 interface. Figure 4 shows the complete topology with router R1 connected to switch S1, which is connected to switch S3 and the output of the 'show cdp neighbors' command on switch S2. Switch S2 is connected to switch S1 through the local interface fastethernet0/4 and is not connected to any other devices that use CDP.
