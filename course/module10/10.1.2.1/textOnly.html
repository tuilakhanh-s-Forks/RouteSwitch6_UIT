          <p>Cisco devices also support Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), which is a vendor-neutral neighbor discovery protocol similar to CDP. LLDP works with network devices, such as routers, switches, and wireless LAN access points. This protocol advertises its identity and capabilities to other devices and receives the information from a physically connected Layer 2 device.</p>
