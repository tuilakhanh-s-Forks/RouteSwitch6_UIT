        <h1>Introduction to Syslog</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When certain events occur on a network, networking devices have trusted mechanisms to notify the administrator with detailed system messages. These messages can be either non-critical or significant. Network administrators have a variety of options for storing, interpreting, and displaying these messages, and for being alerted to those messages that could have the greatest impact on the network infrastructure.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The most common method of accessing system messages is to use a protocol called syslog. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Syslog is a term used to describe a standard. It is also used to describe the protocol developed for that standard. The syslog protocol was developed for UNIX systems in the 1980s, but was first documented as RFC 3164 by IETF in 2001. Syslog uses UDP port 514 to send event notification messages across IP networks to event message collectors, as illustrated in the figure.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many networking devices support syslog, including: routers, switches, application servers, firewalls, and other network appliances. The syslog protocol allows networking devices to send their system messages across the network to syslog servers. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are several different syslog server software packages for Windows and UNIX. Many of them are freeware.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The syslog logging service provides three primary functions:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The ability to gather logging information for monitoring and troubleshooting </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The ability to select the type of logging information that is captured</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The ability to specify the destinations of captured syslog messages</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
