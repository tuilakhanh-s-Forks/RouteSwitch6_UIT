          <p>To enable inter-VLAN routing using router-on-a stick, start by enabling trunking on the switch port that is connected to the router.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the figure, router R1 is connected to switch S1 on trunk port F0/5. VLANs 10 and 30 are added to switch S1. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Because switch port F0/5 is configured as a trunk port, the port does not need to be assigned to any VLAN. To configure switch port F0/5 as a trunk port, execute the<span class="cmd"><b></b></span><b>switchport mode trunk</b><span class="cmd"><b></b></span>command in interface configuration mode for port F0/5. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The router can now be configured to perform inter-VLAN routing.</p>
