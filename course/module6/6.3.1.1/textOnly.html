          <p>VLANs are used to segment switched networks. Layer 2 switches, such as the Catalyst 2960 Series, can be configured with over 4,000 VLANs. A VLAN is a broadcast domain, so computers on separate VLANs are unable to communicate without the intervention of a routing device. Layer 2 switches have very limited IPv4 and IPv6 functionality and cannot perform the dynamic routing function of routers. While Layer 2 switches are gaining more IP functionality, such as the ability to perform static routing, this is insufficient to handle these large number of VLANs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Any device that supports Layer 3 routing, such as a router or a multilayer switch, can be used to perform the necessary routing functionality. Regardless of the device used, the process of forwarding network traffic from one VLAN to another VLAN using routing is known as inter-VLAN routing. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are three options for inter-VLAN routing:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Legacy inter-VLAN routing </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Router-on-a-Stick</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Layer 3 switching using SVIs</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: This chapter focuses on the first two options. Layer 3 switching using SVIs is beyond the scope of this course.</p>
