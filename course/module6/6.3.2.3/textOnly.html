          <p>Now the  router can be configured to perform inter-VLAN routing.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Router interfaces are configured in a manner similar to configuring VLAN interfaces on switches. To configure a specific interface, change to interface configuration mode from global configuration mode. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 1, each interface is configured with an IPv4 address using the<span class="cmd"><b></b></span><b>ip address </b><i>ip_address subnet_mask</i><span class="cmd"><i></i></span>command in interface configuration mode. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the example, interface G0/0 is configured with IPv4 address 172.17.10.1 and subnet mask 255.255.255.0 using the<span class="cmd"><b></b></span><b>ip address 172.17.10.1 255.255.255.0 </b>command. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Router interfaces are disabled by default and must be enabled using the<span class="cmd"><b></b></span><b>no shutdown</b><span class="cmd"><b></b></span>command before they are used. After the<span class="cmd"><b></b></span><b>no shutdown</b><span class="cmd"><b></b></span>interface configuration mode command has been issued, a notification displays, indicating that the interface state has changed to up. This indicates that the interface is now enabled.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The process is repeated for all router interfaces. Each router interface must be assigned to a unique subnet for routing to occur. In this example, the other router interface, G0/1, has been configured to use IPv4 address 172.17.30.1, which is on a different subnet than interface G0/0.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>After the IPv4 addresses are assigned to the physical interfaces and the interfaces are enabled, the router is capable of performing inter-VLAN routing.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Examine the routing table using the<span class="cmd"><b></b></span><b>show ip route</b><span class="cmd"><b></b></span>command. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 2, there are two routes visible in the routing table. One route is to the 172.17.10.0 subnet, which is attached to the local interface G0/0. The other route is to the 172.17.30.0 subnet, which is attached to the local interface G0/1. The router uses this routing table to determine where to send the traffic it receives. For example, if the router receives a packet on interface G0/0 destined for the 172.17.30.0 subnet, the router would identify that it should send the packet out interface G0/1 to reach hosts on the 172.17.30.0 subnet.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Notice the letter<span class="cmd"><b></b></span><b>C </b>to the left of each of the route entries for the VLANs. This letter indicates that the route is local for a connected interface, which is also identified in the route entry. </p>
