        <h1>Changing VLAN Port Membership</h1>
        <div>
          <p>There are a number of ways to change VLAN port membership. Figure 1 shows the syntax for changing a switch port to VLAN 1 membership with the<b> no switchport access vlan </b>interface configuration mode command. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Interface F0/18 was previously assigned to VLAN 20. The<b> no switchport access vlan </b>command is entered for interface F0/18. Examine the output in the<b> show vlan brief</b> command that immediately follows, as shown in Figure 2. The<b> show vlan brief </b>command displays the VLAN assignment and membership type for all switch ports. The<b> show vlan brief</b> command displays one line for each VLAN. The output for each VLAN includes the VLAN name, status, and switch ports.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>VLAN 20 is still active, even though no ports are assigned to it. In Figure 3, the<b> show interfaces f0/18 switchport </b>output verifies that the access VLAN for interface F0/18 has been reset to VLAN 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A port can easily have its VLAN membership changed. It is not necessary to first remove a port from a VLAN to change its VLAN membership. When an access port has its VLAN membership reassigned to another existing VLAN, the new VLAN membership simply replaces the previous VLAN membership. In Figure 4, port F0/11 is assigned to VLAN 20.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 5 to change VLAN port membership.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows a table with the Cisco i. o. s. commands for removing a switchport from a v. lan. Figure two shows the syntax for removing port f. zero slash eighteen from a v. lan and the output of the "show v. lan brief" command to verify that port f. zero slash eighteen is back in v. lan one. Figure three shows the output from the "show interfaces f. a. zero slash eighteen" command. Figure four shows the syntax for configuring f. zero slash eleven as an access port and a member of v. lan twenty.  Also shown, is the output from the "show v. lan brief" command to verify that the port is assigned to the correct v. lan. Figure five is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice working with a switchport and assigning it and unassigning it to a v. lan.</div>
