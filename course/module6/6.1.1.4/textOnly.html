          <p>A separate VLAN is needed to support Voice over IP (VoIP). VoIP traffic requires:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Assured bandwidth to ensure voice quality </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Transmission priority over other types of network traffic</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ability to be routed around congested areas on the network</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Delay of less than 150 ms across the network</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To meet these requirements, the entire network has to be designed to support VoIP. </p>

          <p>In the figure, VLAN 150 is designed to carry voice traffic. The student computer PC5 is attached to the Cisco IP phone, and the phone is attached to switch S3. PC5 is in VLAN 20, which is used for student data. </p>
