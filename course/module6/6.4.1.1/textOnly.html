          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Your company has just purchased a three-level building. You are the network administrator and must design the company inter-VLAN routing network scheme to serve a few employees on each floor.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Floor 1 is occupied by the HR Department, Floor 2 is occupied by the IT Department, and Floor 3 is occupied by the Sales Department. All Departments must be able to communicate with each other, but at the same time have their own separate, working networks.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>You brought three Cisco 2960 switches and a Cisco 1941 series router from the old office location to serve network connectivity in the new building. There is no budget available for new equipment.</p>
