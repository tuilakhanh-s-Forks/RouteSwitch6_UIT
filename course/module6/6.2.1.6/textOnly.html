          <p>After a VLAN is configured, VLAN configurations can be validated using Cisco IOS show commands. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 displays the<b> show vlan </b>and<b> show interfaces </b>command options. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the example in Figure 2, the<b> show vlan name student </b>command produces output that is not easily interpreted. The<b> show vlan summary </b>command displays the count of all configured VLANs. The output in Figure 2 shows seven VLANs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The<b> show interfaces vlan</b><i> vlan-id </i>command displays details that are beyond the scope of this course. The important information appears on the second line in Figure 3, indicating that VLAN 20 is up. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 4 to display the VLAN and switch port information, and to verify VLAN assignments and mode.</p>
