        <h1>Chapter 6: VLANs</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Network performance is an important factor in the productivity of an organization. One of the technologies used to improve network performance is the separation of large broadcast domains into smaller ones. By design, routers will block broadcast traffic at an interface. However, routers normally have a limited number of LAN interfaces. A routerâ€™s primary role is to move information between networks, not to provide network access to end devices. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The role of providing access into a LAN is normally reserved for an access layer switch. A virtual local area network (VLAN) can be created on a Layer 2 switch to reduce the size of broadcast domains, similar to a Layer 3 device. VLANs are commonly incorporated into network design making it easier for a network to support the goals of an organization. While VLANs are primarily used within switched local area networks, modern implementations of VLANs allow them to span MANs and WANs. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Because VLANs segment the network, a Layer 3 process is required to allow traffic to move from one network segment to another.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This Layer 3 routing process can either be implemented using a router or a Layer 3 switch interface. The use of a Layer 3 device provides a method for controlling the flow of traffic between network segments, including network segments created by VLANs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The first part of this chapter will cover how to configure, manage, and troubleshoot VLANs and VLAN trunks. The second part of this chapter focuses on implementing inter-VLAN routing using a router. Inter-VLAN routing on a Layer 3 switch is covered in a later course.</p>
