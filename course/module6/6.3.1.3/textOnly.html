          <p>While legacy inter-VLAN routing requires multiple physical interfaces on both the router and the switch, a more common, present-day implementation of inter-VLAN routing does not. Instead, some router software permits configuring a router interface as a trunk link, meaning only one physical interface is required on the router and the switch to route packets between multiple VLANs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>‘Router-on-a-stick’ is a type of router configuration in which a single physical interface routes traffic between multiple VLANs on a network. As seen in the figure, the router is connected to switch S1 using a single, physical network connection (a trunk). </p>
          <p>The router interface is configured to operate as a trunk link and is connected to a switch port that is configured in trunk mode. The router performs inter-VLAN routing by accepting VLAN-tagged traffic on the trunk interface coming from the adjacent switch, and then, internally routing between the VLANs using subinterfaces. The router then forwards the routed traffic, VLAN-tagged for the destination VLAN, out the same physical interface as it used to receive the traffic.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Subinterfaces are software-based virtual interfaces, associated with a single physical interface. Subinterfaces are configured in software on a router and each subinterface is independently configured with an IP address and VLAN assignment. Subinterfaces are configured for different subnets corresponding to their VLAN assignment to facilitate logical routing. After a routing decision is made based on the destination VLAN, the data frames are VLAN-tagged and sent back out the physical interface. </p>

          <p>As seen in the animation:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>1. PC1 on VLAN 10 is communicating with PC3 on VLAN 30 through router R1 using a single, physical router interface.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>2. PC1 sends its unicast traffic to switch S2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>3. Switch S2 then tags the unicast traffic as originating on VLAN 10 and forwards the unicast traffic out its trunk link to switch S1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>4. Switch S1 forwards the tagged traffic out the other trunk interface on port F0/3 to the interface on router R1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>5. Router R1 accepts the tagged unicast traffic on VLAN 10 and routes it to VLAN 30 using its configured subinterfaces.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>6. The unicast traffic is tagged with VLAN 30 as it is sent out the router interface to switch S1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>7. Switch S1 forwards the tagged unicast traffic out the other trunk link to switch S2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>8. Switch S2 removes the VLAN tag of the unicast frame and forwards the frame out to PC3 on port F0/23.</p>

            <b>Note</b>: The router-on-a-stick method of inter-VLAN routing does not scale beyond 50 VLANs.</p>
