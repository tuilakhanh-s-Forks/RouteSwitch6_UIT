        <h1>IP Addressing Issues with VLAN</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Each VLAN must correspond to a unique IP subnet. If two devices in the same VLAN have different subnet addresses, they cannot communicate. This is a common problem, and it is easy to solve by identifying the incorrect configuration and changing the subnet address to the correct one.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 1, PC1 cannot connect to the Web/TFTP server shown. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A check of the IPv4 configuration settings of PC1 shown in Figure 2, reveals the most common error in configuring VLANs: an incorrectly configured IPv4 address. PC1 is configured with an IPv4 address of 172.172.10.21, but it should have been configured with 172.17.10.21.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 3, the PC1 Fast Ethernet configuration dialog box shows the updated IPv4 address of 172.17.10.21. The output on the bottom reveals that PC1 has regained connectivity to the Web/TFTP server found at IPv4 address 172.17.10.30.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows a small lan with a p. c. connected to switch two, a p. c. connected to switch three, and a web server connected to switch one.  The links between the switches are trunk links and the necessary v. lans are allowed.  The p. c. connected to switch two has a callout stating that it cannot connect to the web server. Figure two shows the output from the "i. p. config" command on the p. c. Figure three shows a screenshot for configuring the i. p. address on the p. c. to change it to the correct subnet.  Note that the screenshot is from a p. c. in packet tracer.  Below is the output from a ping command on the p. c. showing a successful ping to the web server.</div>
