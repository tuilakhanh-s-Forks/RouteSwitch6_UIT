          <p>A host route can be a manually configured static route to direct traffic to a specific destination device, such as an authentication server. The static route uses a destination IP address and a 255.255.255.255 (/32) mask for IPv4 host routes and a /128 prefix length for IPv6 host routes. Static routes are marked with “S” in the output of the routing table. An IPv4 and an IPv6 host route is configured on the BRANCH router to access the server in the topology in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For IPv6 static routes, the next-hop address can be the link-local address of the adjacent router. However, you must specify an interface type and an interface number when using a link-local address as the next hop, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 3 to configure and verify IPv4 and IPv6 static host routes.</p>
