          <p>Routers commonly use default routes that are either configured locally or learned from another router, using a dynamic routing protocol. A default route does not require any left-most bits to match between the default route and the destination IPv4 address. A default route is used when no other routes in the routing table match the destination IP address of the packet. In other words, if a more specific match does not exist, then the default route is used as the Gateway of Last Resort. </p>

          <p>Default static routes are commonly used when connecting:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>An edge router to a service provider network</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>A stub router (a router with only one upstream neighbor router) </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in the figure, the command syntax for a default static route is similar to any other static route, except that the network address is<b> 0.0.0.0 </b>and the subnet mask is<b> 0.0.0.0</b>. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: An IPv4 default static route is commonly referred to as a quad-zero route. </p>
