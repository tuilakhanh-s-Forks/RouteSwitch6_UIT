          <p>R1 can be configured with three static routes to reach all of the remote networks in our topology. However, R1 is a stub router because it is only connected to R2. Therefore, it would be more efficient to configure a default static IPv6 route.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The example in the figure displays a configuration for a default static IPv6 route on R1.</p>
