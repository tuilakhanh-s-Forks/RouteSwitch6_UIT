          <p>A default route is a route that matches all packets and is used by the router if a packet does not match any other, more specific route in the routing table. A default route can be dynamically learned or statically configured. A default static route is simply a static route with 0.0.0.0/0 as the destination IPv4 address. Configuring a default static route creates a Gateway of Last Resort. </p>

          <p>Default static routes are used:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>When no other routes in the routing table match the packet destination IP address. In other words, when a more specific match does not exist. A common use is when connecting a company's edge router to the ISP network.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>When a router has only one other router to which it is connected. In this situation, the router is known as a stub router.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Refer to the figure for a stub network default route scenario.</p>
