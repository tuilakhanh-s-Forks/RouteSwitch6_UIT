          <p>Because the default static route on R1 to R2 has an administrative distance of 1, traffic from R1 to R3 should go through R2. The output in Figure 1 confirms that traffic between R1 and R3 flows through R2. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>What would happen if R2 failed? To simulate this failure both serial interfaces of R2 are shut down, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Notice in Figure 3 that R1 automatically generates messages indicating that the serial interface to R2 is down. A look at the routing table verifies that the default route is now pointing to R3 using the floating static default route configured with an AD value of 5 and a next-hop of 10.10.10.2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The output in Figure 4 confirms that traffic now flows directly between R1 and R3. </p>
