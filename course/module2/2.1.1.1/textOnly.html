          <p>A router can learn about remote networks in one of two ways:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Manually </b>- Remote networks are manually entered into the route table using static routes.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Dynamically </b>- Remote routes are automatically learned using a dynamic routing protocol. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 provides a sample scenario of static routing. Figure 2 provides a sample scenario of dynamic routing using EIGRP.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A network administrator can manually configure a static route to reach a specific network. Unlike a dynamic routing protocol, static routes are not automatically updated and must be manually reconfigured any time the network topology changes. </p>
