          <p>A default route is a static route that matches all packets. Instead of routers storing routes for all of the networks in the Internet, they can store a single default route to represent any network that is not in the routing table. A default route does not require any left-most bits to match between the default route and the destination IPv6 address.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Routers commonly use default routes that are either configured locally, or learned from another router using a dynamic routing protocol. They are used when no other routes match the packet's destination IP address in the routing table. In other words, if a more specific match does not exist, then use the default route as the Gateway of Last Resort. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Default static routes are commonly used when connecting:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>A company's edge router to a service provider network.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>A router with only an upstream neighbor router. The router has no other neighbors and is therefore, referred to as a stub router. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in the figure, the command syntax for a default static route is similar to any other static route, except that the ipv6-prefix/prefix-length is<span class="cmd"><b></b></span><b>::/0</b>, which matches all routes. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The basic command syntax of a default static route is:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>ipv6 route ::/0</b>
                <span class="cmd">
                  <b></b>
                </span>{<i>ipv6-address </i>|<i> exit-intf</i>}</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
