          <p>In this activity, you will configure IPv6 static and default routes. A static route is a route that is entered manually by the network administrator to create a route that is reliable and safe. There are four different static routes used in this activity: a recursive static route; a directly connected static route; a fully specified static route; and a default route.</p>
