        <h1>Configure a Next-Hop Static Route</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In a next-hop static route, only the next-hop IP address is specified. The exit interface is derived from the next hop. For example, in Figure 1, three next-hop static routes are configured on R1 using the IP address of the next hop, R2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Before any packet is forwarded by a router, the routing table process must determine the exit interface to use to forward the packet. This is known as route resolvability. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 details the basic packet forwarding process in the routing table for R1. When a packet is destined for the 192.168.2.0/24 network, R1:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>1. Looks for a match in the routing table and finds that it has to forward the packets to the next-hop IPv4 address 172.16.2.2, as indicated by the label 1 in the figure. Every route that references only a next-hop IPv4 address and does not reference an exit interface must have the next-hop IPv4 address resolved using another route in the routing table with an exit interface.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>2. R1 must now determine how to reach 172.16.2.2; therefore, it searches a second time for a 172.16.2.2 match. In this case, the IPv4 address matches the route for the directly connected network 172.16.2.0/24 with the exit interface Serial 0/0/0, as indicated by the label 2 in the figure. This lookup tells the routing table process that this packet is forwarded out of that interface. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It actually takes two routing table lookup processes to forward any packet to the 192.168.2.0/24 network. When the router performs multiple lookups in the routing table before forwarding a packet, it is performing a process known as a recursive lookup. Because recursive lookups consume router resources, they should be avoided when possible.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A recursive static route is valid (that is, it is a candidate for insertion in the routing table) only when the specified next hop resolves, either directly or indirectly, to a valid exit interface. If the exit interface is “down” or “administratively down”, then the static route will not be installed in the routing table.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figures 3 and 4 to configure and verify next-hop static routes on R2 and R3.</p>

      <div id="media-description">These figures are based on the standard lab diagram.  R. 1. with a lan connects to R. 2. with a lan which connects to R. 3. with a lan. Figure one shows the configuring of the two lans that router 1 is not connected to, the router two lan and the router three lan, as well as the wan between router two and router three.  The static routes were configured using next hop address. Figure two demonstrates the recursive lookup process for router one to reach the lan on router three.  This process is required whenever a static route is entered using a next hop versus an exit interface. Figure three is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure a static route on router two to reach the router three lan using next hop address. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure static routes on router three pointing to the networks on the other side of router two.</div>
