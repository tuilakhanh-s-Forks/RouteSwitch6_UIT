          <p>In a next-hop static route, only the next-hop IP address is specified. The exit interface is derived from the next hop. For example, in Figure 1, three next-hop static routes are configured on R1 using the IP address of the next hop, R2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Before any packet is forwarded by a router, the routing table process must determine the exit interface to use to forward the packet. This is known as route resolvability. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 details the basic packet forwarding process in the routing table for R1. When a packet is destined for the 192.168.2.0/24 network, R1:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>1. Looks for a match in the routing table and finds that it has to forward the packets to the next-hop IPv4 address 172.16.2.2, as indicated by the label 1 in the figure. Every route that references only a next-hop IPv4 address and does not reference an exit interface must have the next-hop IPv4 address resolved using another route in the routing table with an exit interface.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>2. R1 must now determine how to reach 172.16.2.2; therefore, it searches a second time for a 172.16.2.2 match. In this case, the IPv4 address matches the route for the directly connected network 172.16.2.0/24 with the exit interface Serial 0/0/0, as indicated by the label 2 in the figure. This lookup tells the routing table process that this packet is forwarded out of that interface. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It actually takes two routing table lookup processes to forward any packet to the 192.168.2.0/24 network. When the router performs multiple lookups in the routing table before forwarding a packet, it is performing a process known as a recursive lookup. Because recursive lookups consume router resources, they should be avoided when possible.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A recursive static route is valid (that is, it is a candidate for insertion in the routing table) only when the specified next hop resolves, either directly or indirectly, to a valid exit interface. If the exit interface is “down” or “administratively down”, then the static route will not be installed in the routing table.</p>

          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figures 3 and 4 to configure and verify next-hop static routes on R2 and R3.</p>
