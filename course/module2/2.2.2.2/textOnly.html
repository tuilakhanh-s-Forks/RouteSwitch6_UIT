          <p>R1 can be configured with three static routes to reach all of the remote networks in the example topology. However, R1 is a stub router because it is only connected to R2. Therefore, it would be more efficient to configure a default static route.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The example in the figure configures a default static route on R1. With the configuration shown in the example, any packets not matching more specific route entries are forwarded to 172.16.2.2. </p>
