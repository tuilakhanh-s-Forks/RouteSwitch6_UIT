        <h1>Floating Static Routes</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Floating static routes are static routes that have an administrative distance greater than the administrative distance of another static route or dynamic routes. They are very useful when providing a backup to a primary link, as shown in the figure. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>By default, static routes have an administrative distance of 1, making them preferable to routes learned from dynamic routing protocols. For example, the administrative distances of some common dynamic routing protocols are:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>EIGRP = 90</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>IGRP = 100</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>OSPF = 110</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>IS-IS = 115</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>RIP = 120</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The administrative distance of a static route can be increased to make the route less desirable than that of another static route or a route learned through a dynamic routing protocol. In this way, the static route “floats” and is not used when the route with the better administrative distance is active. However, if the preferred route is lost, the floating static route can take over, and traffic can be sent through this alternate route. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows two routers, and each have 2 paths to connect to the other.  One path is through the internal network and the other path can be through the Internet.  There might be a primary E. I. G. R. P route between them.  The administrator can configure a floating static route as an alternate path in the event the other path fails.</div>
