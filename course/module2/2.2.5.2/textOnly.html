          <p>IPv4 floating static routes are configured using the<b> ip route </b>global configuration command and specifying an administrative distance. If no administrative distance is configured, the default value (1) is used.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Refer to the topology in Figure 1. In this scenario, the preferred default route from R1 is to R2. The connection to R3 should be used for backup only.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>R1 is configured with a default static route pointing to R2. Because no administrative distance is configured, the default value (1) is used for this static route. R1 is also configured with a floating static default pointing to R3 with an administrative distance of 5. This value is greater than the default value of 1 and therefore; this route floats and is not present in the routing table, unless the preferred route fails.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 verifies that the default route to R2 is installed in the routing table. Note that the backup route to R3 is not present in the routing table.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 3 to configure R3 similarly to R1.</p>
