          <p>In this activity, you will configure IPv4 and IPv6 floating static routes. These routes are manually configured with an administrative distance greater than that of the primary route and, therefore, would not be in the routing table until the primary route fails. You will test failover to the backup routes, and then restore connectivity to the primary route.</p>
