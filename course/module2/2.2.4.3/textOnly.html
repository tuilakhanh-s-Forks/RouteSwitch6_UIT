          <p>Unlike IPv4, IPv6 does not explicitly state that the default IPv6 is the Gateway of Last Resort. </p>

          <p>The key to this configuration is the ::/0 mask. Remember that the IPv6 prefix-length in a routing table determines how many bits must match between the destination IP address of the packet and the route in the routing table. The ::/0 mask indicates that none of the bits are required to match. As long as a more specific match does not exist, the default static IPv6 route matches all packets.</p>
