          <p>As shown in the figure, static routes are most often used to connect to a specific network or to provide a Gateway of Last Resort for a stub network. They can also be used to:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduce the number of routes advertised by summarizing several contiguous networks as one static route</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create a backup route in case a primary route link fails</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The following types of IPv4 and IPv6 static routes will be discussed:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Standard static route</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Default static route</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Summary static route</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Floating static route</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
