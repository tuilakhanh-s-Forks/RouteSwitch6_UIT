          <p>Working with decimal representations of binary wildcard mask bits can be tedious. To simplify this task, the keywords<b> host </b>and<b> any</b> help identify the most common uses of wildcard masking. These keywords eliminate entering wildcard masks when identifying a specific host or an entire network. These keywords also make it easier to read an ACL by providing visual clues as to the source or destination of the criteria.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The<b> host</b> keyword substitutes for the 0.0.0.0 mask. This mask states that all IPv4 address bits must match to filter just one host address.</p>
          <p>The <b>any</b> option substitutes for the IPv4 address and 255.255.255.255 mask. This mask says to ignore the entire IPv4 address or to accept any addresses. </p>

            <b>Example 1: Wildcard Masking Process with a Single IPv4 Address</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Example 1 in the figure, instead of entering <b>192.168.10.10 0.0.0.0</b>, you can use <b>host 192.168.10.10</b>. </p>

            <b>Example 2: Wildcard Masking Process with a Match Any IPv4 Address</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Example 2 in the figure, instead of entering <b>0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255</b>, you can use the keyword<b> any</b> by itself.</p>
