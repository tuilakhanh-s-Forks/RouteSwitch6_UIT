          <p>The topology in the figure is used to demonstration how a standard ACL can be placed. The administrator wants to prevent traffic originating in the 192.168.10.0/24 network from reaching the 192.168.30.0/24 network. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Following the basic placement guidelines of placing the standard ACL close to the destination, the figure shows two possible interfaces on R3 to apply the standard ACL: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>R3 S0/0/1 interface </b>- Applying a standard ACL to prevent traffic from 192.168.10.0/24 from entering the S0/0/1 interface will prevent this traffic from reaching 192.168.30.0/24 and all other networks reachable by R3. This includes the 192.168.31.0/24 network. Because the intent of the ACL is to filter traffic destined only for 192.168.30.0/24, a standard ACL should not be applied to this interface.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>R3 G0/0 interface </b>- Applying the standard ACL to traffic exiting the G0/0 interface will filter packets from 192.168.10.0/24 to 192.168.30.0/24. This will not affect other networks reachable by R3. Packets from 192.168.10.0/24 will still be able to reach 192.168.31.0/24.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
