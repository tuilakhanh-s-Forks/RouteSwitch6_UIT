          <p>A single-entry ACL with only one deny entry has the effect of denying all traffic. At least one permit ACE must be configured in an ACL or all traffic is blocked.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For the network in the figure, applying either ACL 1 or ACL 2 to the S0/0/0 interface of R1 in the outbound direction will have the same effect. Network 192.168.10.0 will be permitted to access the networks reachable through S0/0/0, while 192.168.11.0 will not be allowed to access those networks. In ACL 1, if a packet does not match the permit statement, it is discarded.</p>
