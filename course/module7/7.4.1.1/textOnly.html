          <p>
            <b>Scenario </b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It was recently reported that viruses are on the rise within your small- to medium-sized business network. Your network administrator has been tracking network performance and has determined that one particular host is constantly downloading files from a remote FTP server. This host just may be the virus source perpetuating throughout the network!</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use Packet Tracer to complete this activity. Write a named ACL to deny the host access to the FTP server.  Apply the ACL to the most effective interface on the router. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To complete the physical topology, you must use:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>One PC host station</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Two switches </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>One Cisco 1941 series Integrated Services Router</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>One server</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Using the Packet Tracer text tool, record the ACL you prepared. Validate that the ACL works to deny access to the FTP server by trying to access the FTP serverâ€™s address. Observe what happens while in simulation mode.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Save your file and be prepared to share it with another student, or with the entire class.</p>
