Figure shows a network of three routers.  R-2 is at the top of a triangle layout and has a serial WAN connection to both R-1 and R-3.  There is no direct connection between R-1 and R-3. R-2 also has a connection to the Internet.  Routers R-1 and R-3 each have two active gigabit interfaces for local network segments, and each segment has a switch with a computer connected to the switch.  R-1 has network 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero on interface gigabit zero slash zero, and network 192 dot 168 dot 11 dot zero on interface gigabit zero slash one.  R-3 has network 192 dot 168 dot 30 dot zero on interface gigabit zero slash zero.  All segments are class C networks with a slash 24.  This is the reference topology for the next series of pages.  Figure 1 shows the output from the show access-list command. Figure 2 shows the output for the interface section of the running configuration. Interface g0/1 is highlighted because it has the ACL incorrectly applied to it. Figure 3 shows the process of removing the ACL for g0/1 and applying it to g0/0 in the correct outbound direction.
