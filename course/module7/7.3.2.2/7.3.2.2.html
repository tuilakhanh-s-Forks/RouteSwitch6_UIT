            <b>Security Policy</b>: The 192.168.11.0/24 network should not be able to access the 192.168.10.0/24 network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 1, PC2 cannot access PC1. Nor can it access the Internet through R2. When viewing the output of the <b>show access-list</b> command, you can see that PC2 is matching the deny statement. ACL 20 seems to be configured correctly. You suspect that it must be incorrectly applied and view the interface configurations for R1</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 2, the <b>show run</b> command filtered to view the interface configurations reveals that ACL 20 was applied to the wrong interface and in the wrong direction. All traffic from the 192.168.11.0/24 is denied inbound access through the G0/1 interface.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Solution</b>: To correct this error, remove ACL 20 from the G0/1 interface and apply it outbound on the G0/0 interface, as shown in Figure 3. PC2 cannot access PC1, but can now access the Internet.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows a network of three routers.  R-2 is at the top of a triangle layout and has a serial WAN connection to both R-1 and R-3.  There is no direct connection between R-1 and R-3. R-2 also has a connection to the Internet.  Routers R-1 and R-3 each have two active gigabit interfaces for local network segments, and each segment has a switch with a computer connected to the switch.  R-1 has network 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero on interface gigabit zero slash zero, and network 192 dot 168 dot 11 dot zero on interface gigabit zero slash one.  R-3 has network 192 dot 168 dot 30 dot zero on interface gigabit zero slash zero.  All segments are class C networks with a slash 24.  This is the reference topology for the next series of pages.  Figure 1 shows the output from the show access-list command. Figure 2 shows the output for the interface section of the running configuration. Interface g0/1 is highlighted because it has the ACL incorrectly applied to it. Figure 3 shows the process of removing the ACL for g0/1 and applying it to g0/0 in the correct outbound direction.  </div>
