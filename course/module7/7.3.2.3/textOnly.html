            <b>Security Policy</b>: Only PC1 is allowed SSH remote access to R1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 1, PC1 is unable to remotely access R1 using an SSH connection. Viewing the running configuration section for the VTY lines reveals that an ACL named PC1-SSH is correctly applied for inbound connections. The VTY lines are correctly configured to only allow SSH connections. From the output of the show access-list command, you notice that the IPv4 address is the G0/0 interface for R1, not the IPv4 address of PC1. Also, notice that the administrator configured an explicit deny any statement in the ACL. This is helpful because, in this situation, you will see matches for failed attempts to remotely access R1. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Solution</b>: Figure 2 shows the process for correcting the error. Because the statement that needs to be corrected is the first statement, we use the sequence number 10 to delete it by entering <b>no 10</b>. We then configure the correct IPv4 address for PC1. The <b>clear access-list counters</b> command resets the output to only show new matches. An attempt from PC2 to remotely access R1 is successful, as shown in the output for the <b>show access-list</b> command.</p>
