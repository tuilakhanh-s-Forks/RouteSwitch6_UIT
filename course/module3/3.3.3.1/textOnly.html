          <p>When a packet arrives on a router interface, the router examines the IPv4 header, identifies the destination IPv4 address, and proceeds through the router lookup process.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 1, the router examines level 1 network routes for the best match with the destination address of the IPv4 packet:</p>
          <p>1. If the best match is a level 1 ultimate route, then this route is used to forward the packet.</p>
          <p>2. If the best match is a level 1 parent route, proceed to the next step.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 2, the router examines child routes (the subnet routes) of the parent route for a best match:</p>
          <p>3. If there is a match with a level 2 child route, that subnet is used to forward the packet.</p>
          <p>4. If there is not a match with any of the level 2 child routes, proceed to the next step.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 3, the router continues searching level 1 supernet routes in the routing table for a match, including the default route, if there is one:</p>
          <p>5. If there is now a lesser match with a level 1 supernet or default routes, the router uses that route to forward the packet.</p>
          <p>6. If there is not a match with any route in the routing table, the router drops the packet.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: A route referencing only a next-hop IP address and not an exit interface, must be resolved to a route with an exit interface, if Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) is not being used. Without CEF, a recursive lookup is performed on the next-hop IP address until the route is resolved to an exit interface. CEF is enabled by default.</p>
