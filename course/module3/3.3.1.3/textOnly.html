          <p>The figure displays an IPv4 routing table entry on R1 for the route to remote network 172.16.4.0 on R3. The entry identifies the following information:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Route source </b>- Identifies how the route was learned. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Destination network </b>- Identifies the address of the remote network.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Administrative distance (AD) </b>- Identifies the trustworthiness of the route source. The AD for static routes is 1 and the AD for connected routes is 0. Dynamic routing protocols have an AD higher than 1 depending upon the protocol.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Metric </b>- Identifies the value assigned to reach the remote network. Lower values indicate preferred routes. The metric for static and connected routes is 0.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Next hop </b>- Identifies the IPv4 address of the next router to forward the packet to.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Route timestamp </b>- Identifies from when the route was last heard.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Outgoing interface </b>- Identifies the exit interface to use to forward a packet toward the final destination.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
