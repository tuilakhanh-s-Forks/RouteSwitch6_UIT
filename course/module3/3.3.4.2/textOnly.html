          <p>The routing table of R1 is displayed in Figure 1 using the<b> show ipv6 route </b>command. Although, the command output is displayed slightly differently than in the IPv4 version, it still contains the relevant route information. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 highlights the connected network and local routing table entries of the directly connected interfaces. The three entries were added when the interfaces were configured and activated. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 3, directly connected route entries display the following information:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Route source </b>- Identifies how the route was learned. Directly connected interfaces have two route source codes (C identifies a directly connected network while L identifies that this is a local route.) </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Directly connected network </b>- The IPv6 address of the directly connected network.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Administrative distance </b>- Identifies the trustworthiness of the route source. IPv6 uses the same distances as IPv4. A value of 0 indicates the best, most trustworthy source.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Metric </b>- Identifies the value assigned to reach the remote network. Lower values indicate preferred routes. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Outgoing interface </b>- Identifies the exit interface to use when forwarding packets to the destination network.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The serial links have reference bandwidths configured to observe how EIGRP metrics select the best route. The reference bandwidth is not a realistic representation of modern networks. It is used only to provide a visual depiction of link speed.</p>
