          <p>A level 2 child route is a route that is a subnet of a classful network address. As illustrated in Figure 1, a level 1 parent route is a level 1 network route that is subnetted. Level 1 parent routes contain level 2 child routes, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Like a level 1 route, the source of a level 2 route can be a directly connected network, a static route, or a dynamically learned route. Level 2 child routes are also ultimate routes.</p>

            <b>Note</b>: The routing table hierarchy in Cisco IOS has a classful routing scheme. A level 1 parent route is the classful network address of the subnet route. This is the case even if a classless routing protocol is the source of the subnet route.</p>

          <p>Figure 3 highlights the child routes in the routing table of R1.</p>
