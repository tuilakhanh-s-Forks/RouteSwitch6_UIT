        <h1>Dynamic Routing Advantages and Disadvantages</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The table in the figure highlights the advantages and disadvantages of dynamic routing. Dynamic routing protocols work well in any type of network consisting of several routers. They are scalable and automatically determine better routes if there is a change in the topology.  Although there is more to the configuration of dynamic routing protocols, they are simpler to configure than static routing in a large network. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are disadvantages to dynamic routing. Dynamic routing requires knowledge of additional commands. It is also less secure than static routing because the interfaces identified by the routing protocol send routing updates out. Routes taken may differ between packets. The routing algorithm uses additional CPU, RAM, and link bandwidth.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Notice how dynamic routing addresses the disadvantages of static routing. </p>
