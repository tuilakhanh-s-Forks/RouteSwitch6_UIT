At home, a user may have a router and two or more computers.  At work, an organization may have multiple routers and switches servicing the data communication needs of hundreds or even thousands of PCs.  </p>

          <p>Routers forward packets by using information in the routing table.  Routes to remote networks can be learned by the router in two ways: static routes and dynamic routes.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In a large network with numerous networks and subnets, configuring and maintaining static routes between these networks requires a great deal of administrative and operational overhead.  This operational overhead is especially cumbersome when changes to the network occur, such as a down link or implementing a new subnet.  Implementing dynamic routing protocols can ease the burden of configuration and maintenance tasks and give the network scalability.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This chapter introduces dynamic routing protocols. It compares the use of static and dynamic routing. Then the implementation of dynamic routing using the Routing Information Protocol version 1 (RIPv1) and version 2 (RIPv2) is discussed. The chapter concludes with an in-depth look at the routing table.</p>
