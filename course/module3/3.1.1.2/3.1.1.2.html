        <h1>Dynamic Routing Protocol Components</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Routing protocols are used to facilitate the exchange of routing information between routers. A routing protocol is a set of processes, algorithms, and messages that are used to exchange routing information and populate the routing table with the routing protocol's choice of best paths. The purpose of dynamic routing protocols includes:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Discovery of remote networks</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Maintaining up-to-date routing information</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Choosing the best path to destination networks</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ability to find a new best path if the current path is no longer available</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The main components of dynamic routing protocols include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Data structures -</b> Routing protocols typically use tables or databases for its operations. This information is kept in RAM.  </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Routing protocol messages -</b> Routing protocols use various types of messages to discover neighboring routers, exchange routing information, and other tasks to learn and maintain accurate information about the network. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Algorithm -</b> An algorithm is a finite list of steps used to accomplish a task. Routing protocols use algorithms for facilitating routing information and for best path determination.  </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Routing protocols allow routers to dynamically share information about remote networks and automatically offer this information to their own routing tables. Click Play in the figure to see an animation of this process.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Routing protocols determine the best path, or route, to each network. That route is then offered to the routing table. The route will be installed in the routing table is there is not another routing source with a lower administrative distance. For example, a static route with an administrative distance of 1 will have precedence over the same network learned by a dynamic routing protocol. A primary benefit of dynamic routing protocols is that routers exchange routing information when there is a topology change. This exchange allows routers to automatically learn about new networks and also to find alternate paths when there is a link failure to a current network.  </p>
