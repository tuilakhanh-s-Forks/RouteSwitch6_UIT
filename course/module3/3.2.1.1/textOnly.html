          <p>Although RIP is rarely used in modern networks, it is useful as a foundation for understanding basic network routing. This section provides a brief overview of how to configure basic RIP settings and how to verify RIPv2. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Refer to the reference topology in Figure 1 and the addressing table in Figure 2. In this scenario, all routers have been configured with basic management features and all interfaces identified in the reference topology are configured and enabled. There are no static routes configured and no routing protocols enabled; therefore, remote network access is currently impossible. RIPv1 is used as the dynamic routing protocol. To enable RIP, use the<b> router rip </b>command, as shown in Figure 3. This command does not directly start the RIP process. Instead, it provides access to the router configuration mode where the RIP routing settings are configured. When enabling RIP, the default version is RIPv1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To disable and eliminate RIP, use the<b> no router rip </b>global configuration command. This command stops the RIP process and erases all existing RIP configurations. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 4 displays the various RIP commands that can be configured. The highlighted keywords are covered in this section. </p>
