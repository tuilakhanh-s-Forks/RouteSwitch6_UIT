        <h1>IPv6 Routing Table Entries</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Components of the IPv6 routing table are very similar to the IPv4 routing table. For instance, it is populated using directly connected interfaces, static routes, and dynamically learned routes. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Because IPv6 is classless by design, all routes are effectively level 1 ultimate routes. There is no level 1 parent of level 2 child routes. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The topology displayed in the figure is used as the reference topology for this section.  Notice that in the topology:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>R1, R2, and R3 are configured in a full mesh topology. All routers have redundant paths to various networks.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>R2 is the edge router and connects to the ISP; however, a default static route is not being advertised.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>EIGRP for IPv6 has been configured on all three routers.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Although EIGRP for IPv6 is used to populate the routing tables, the operation and configuration of EIGRP is beyond the scope of this course.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows a topology of three routers configured in a triangle layout. Each router is connected to the other two routers giving a full mesh topology.  Each router has two active serial WAN links with I.P.v.6. addresses and each router has a LAN on a gigabit Ethernet interface with an I.P.v.6. address.  The routing protocol used is E.I.G.R.P. for I.P.V.6.</div>
