          <p>A level 1 route is a route with a subnet mask equal to or less than the classful mask of the network address. Therefore, a level 1 route can be a:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Network route </b>- A network route that has a subnet mask equal to that of the classful mask. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Supernet route </b>- A supernet route is a network address with a mask less than the classful mask, for example, a summary address. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Default route </b>- A default route is a static route with the address 0.0.0.0/0.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The source of the level 1 route can be a directly connected network, static route, or a dynamic routing protocol.</p>
