          <p>By default, RIP updates are forwarded out all RIP-enabled interfaces. However, RIP updates really only need to be sent out interfaces that are connected to other RIPenabled routers.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For instance, refer to the topology in Figure 1. RIP sends updates out of its G0/0 interface even though no RIP device exists on that LAN.  R1 has no way of knowing this and, as a result, sends an update every 30 seconds. Sending out unneeded updates on a LAN impacts the network in three ways:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Wasted Bandwidth </b>- Bandwidth is used to transport unnecessary updates. Because RIP updates are either broadcasted or multicasted, switches also forward the updates out all ports.  </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Wasted Resources </b>- All devices on the LAN must process the update up to the transport layers, at which point the devices will discard the update. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Security Risk </b>- Advertising updates on a broadcast network is a security risk. RIP updates can be intercepted with packet sniffing software.  Routing updates can be modified and sent back to the router, corrupting the routing table with false metrics that misdirect traffic. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the<b> passive-interface </b>router configuration command to prevent the transmission of routing updates through a router interface, but still allow that network to be advertised to other routers. The command stops routing updates out the specified interface. However, the network that the specified interface belongs to is still advertised in routing updates that are sent out other interfaces.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There is no need for R1, R2, and R3 to forward RIP updates out of their LAN interfaces. The configuration in Figure 2 identifies the R1 G0/0 interface as passive. The<b> show ip protocols </b>command is then used to verify that the Gigabit Ethernet interface was passive. Notice that the G0/0 interface is no longer listed as sending or receiving version 2 updates, but instead is now listed under the Passive Interface(s) section. Also notice that the network 192.168.1.0 is still listed under Routing for Networks, which means that this network is still included as a route entry in RIP updates that are sent to R2. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: All routing protocols support the<b> passive-interface </b>command.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 3 to configure the LAN interface as a passive interface on R2 and R3.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As an alternative, all interfaces can be made passive using the<b> passive-interface default </b>command. Interfaces that should not be passive can be re-enabled using the<b> no passive-interface </b>command.</p>
