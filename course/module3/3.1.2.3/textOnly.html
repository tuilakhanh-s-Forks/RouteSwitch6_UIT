          <p>Dynamic routing protocols help the network administrator manage the time-consuming and exacting process of configuring and maintaining static routes.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Imagine maintaining the static routing configurations for the seven routers in Figure 1.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>What if the company grew and now had four regions and 28 routers to manage, as shown in Figure 2? What happens when a link goes down? How do you ensure that redundant paths are available? </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Dynamic routing is the best choice for large networks like the one shown. </p>
