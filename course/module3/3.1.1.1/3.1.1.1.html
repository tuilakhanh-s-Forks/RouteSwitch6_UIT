        <h1>Dynamic Routing Protocol Evolution</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Dynamic routing protocols have been used in networks since the late 1980s. One of the first routing protocols was RIP. RIPv1 was released in 1988, but some of the basic algorithms within the protocol were used on the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) as early as 1969. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As networks evolved and became more complex, new routing protocols emerged. The RIP protocol was updated to RIPv2 to accommodate growth in the network environment.  However, RIPv2 still does not scale to the larger network implementations of today.  To address the needs of larger networks, two advanced routing protocols were developed: Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS). Cisco developed the Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) and Enhanced IGRP (EIGRP), which also scales well in larger network implementations. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Additionally, there was the need to connect different internetworks and provide routing between them. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is now used between Internet service providers (ISPs).  BGP is also used between ISPs and their larger private clients to exchange routing information. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 displays the timeline of when the various protocols were introduced. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 classifies the protocols. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>With the advent of numerous consumer devices using IP, the IPv4 addressing space is nearly exhausted; thus, IPv6 has emerged. To support the communication based on IPv6, newer versions of the IP routing protocols have been developed, as shown in the IPv6 row in the Figure 2. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one is an interactive timeline for the evolution of routing protocols beginning with the Exterior Gateway Protocol in the year 1980 through the development of E.I.G.R.P for I.P.v.6. in 2005.  Other notable events include the release of Routing Information Protocol version 1 in 1988, followed by O.S.P.F. version 1 in 1989, and version 2 in 1991.  1992 saw the release of E.I.G.R.P. and 1993 saw R.I.P. version 2.  R.I.P. next generation for I.P.v.6. came out in 1997, followed by Version 3 of O.S.P.F. in 1999.Figure two is a table that organizes the routing protocols into interior routing protocols and exterior routing protocols, and classifies each as either used for I.P. version 4 or I.P. version 6.</div>
