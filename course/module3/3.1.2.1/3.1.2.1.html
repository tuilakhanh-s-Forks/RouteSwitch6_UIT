        <h1>Static Routing Uses </h1>
        <div>
          <p>Before identifying the benefits of dynamic routing protocols, consider the reasons why network professionals use static routing.  Dynamic routing certainly has several advantages over static routing; however, static routing is still used in networks today.  In fact, networks typically use a combination of both static and dynamic routing. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Static routing has several primary uses, including: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Providing ease of routing table maintenance in smaller networks that are not expected to grow significantly. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Routing to and from a stub network, which is a network with only one default route out and no knowledge of any remote networks. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Accessing a single default route (which is used to represent a path to any network that does not have a more specific match with another route in the routing table). </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The figure provides a sample scenario of static routing. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows two routers connected by a serial WAN link.  Each router has 2 local networks on the gigabit Ethernet ports.  The figure identifies the left router as R-1 and the router on the right as R-2.  The figure explains that R-2 is connected to the Internet and is the only path for data to leave from R-1. Therefore, R-1 will have a default static route that signifies this.  R-2 knows that there are only two networks attached to R-1, so it requires 2 static route entries in the routing table to reach those two networks.</div>
