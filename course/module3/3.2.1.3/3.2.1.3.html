        <h1>Verify RIP Routing</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The<b> show ip protocols </b>command displays the IPv4 routing protocol settings currently configured on the router. This output displayed in Figure 1 confirms most RIP parameters including:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>1. RIP routing is configured and running on router R1.</p>
          <p>2. The values of various timers; for example, the next routing update, is sent by R1 in 16 seconds.</p>
          <p>3. The version of RIP configured is currently RIPv1.</p>
          <p>4. R1 is currently summarizing at the classful network boundary.</p>
          <p>5. The classful networks are advertised by R1. These are the networks that R1 includes in its RIP updates.</p>
          <p>6. The RIP neighbors are listed, including their next-hop IP address, the associated AD that R2 uses for updates sent by this neighbor, and when the last update was received from this neighbor.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: This command is also very useful when verifying the operations of other routing protocols (i.e., EIGRP and OSPF). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The<b> show ip route </b>command displays the RIP routes installed in the routing table. In Figure 2, R1 now knows about the highlighted networks. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 3 to verify the R2 and R3 RIP settings and routes.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows the output from the command show i.p. protocols.  This router is running RIP version 1 and the output displays the values listed in the reading.  Figure two shows the output from the command show i.p. route pipe begin Gateway.  This lists the routing table showing two connected routes, two interface i.p. addresses, and three network routes learned via the RIP protocol.  These three networks are listed with a capital R in the table meaning that they were learned through RIP updates. Figure three is an interactive media element that allows the learner to use the show i.p. protocols command and the show i.p. route command to view the current routing protocol configuration and the routing table for a router.</div>
