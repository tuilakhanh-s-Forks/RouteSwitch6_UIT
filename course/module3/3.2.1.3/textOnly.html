          <p>The<b> show ip protocols </b>command displays the IPv4 routing protocol settings currently configured on the router. This output displayed in Figure 1 confirms most RIP parameters including:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>1. RIP routing is configured and running on router R1.</p>
          <p>2. The values of various timers; for example, the next routing update, is sent by R1 in 16 seconds.</p>
          <p>3. The version of RIP configured is currently RIPv1.</p>
          <p>4. R1 is currently summarizing at the classful network boundary.</p>
          <p>5. The classful networks are advertised by R1. These are the networks that R1 includes in its RIP updates.</p>
          <p>6. The RIP neighbors are listed, including their next-hop IP address, the associated AD that R2 uses for updates sent by this neighbor, and when the last update was received from this neighbor.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: This command is also very useful when verifying the operations of other routing protocols (i.e., EIGRP and OSPF). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The<b> show ip route </b>command displays the RIP routes installed in the routing table. In Figure 2, R1 now knows about the highlighted networks. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 3 to verify the R2 and R3 RIP settings and routes.</p>
