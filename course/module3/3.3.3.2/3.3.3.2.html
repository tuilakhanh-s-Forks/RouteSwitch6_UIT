        <h1>Best Route = Longest Match</h1>
        <div>
          <p>What is meant by the router must find the best match in the routing table? Best match is equal to the longest match. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For there to be a match between the destination IPv4 address of a packet and a route in the routing table, a minimum number of far left bits must match between the IPv4 address of the packet and the route in the routing table. The subnet mask of the route in the routing table is used to determine the minimum number of far left bits that must match. Remember that an IPv4 packet only contains the IPv4 address and not the subnet mask. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The best match is the route in the routing table that has the most number of far left matching bits with the destination IPv4 address of the packet. The route with the greatest number of equivalent far left bits, or the longest match, is always the preferred route.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the figure, a packet is destined for 172.16.0.10. The router has three possible routes that match this packet: 172.16.0.0/12, 172.16.0.0/18, and 172.16.0.0/26. Of the three routes, 172.16.0.0/26 has the longest match and is chosen to forward the packet. Remember, for any of these routes to be considered a match there must be at least the number of matching bits indicated by the subnet mask of the route.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows the process for checking for the longest match in the routing table.   The destination address for the packet is 172 dot 16 dot 0 dot 10 and the first step is to list the address in binary, which is one zero one zero one one zero zero dot zero zero zero one zero zero zero zero dot zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero dot zero zero zero zero one zero one zero.  There are three routes that can potentially be used to reach the destination, so the router has to look at each route and compare the binary values from left to right. The one that matches the most bits within the subnet mask will be the route chosen.  The three choices are a slash 12, a slash 18, and a slash 26.  The destination packet matches the most number of bits with the slash 26, so this will be the route selected.</div>
