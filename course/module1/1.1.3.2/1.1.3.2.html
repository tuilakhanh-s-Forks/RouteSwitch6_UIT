        <h1>Configure an IPv4 Router Interface</h1>
        <div>
          <p>One distinguishing feature between switches and routers is the type of interfaces supported by each. For example, Layer 2 switches support LANs and, therefore, have multiple FastEthernet or Gigabit Ethernet ports. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Routers support LANs and WANs and can interconnect different types of networks; therefore, they support many types of interfaces. For example, G2 ISRs have one or two integrated Gigabit Ethernet interfaces and High-Speed WAN Interface Card (HWIC) slots to accommodate other types of network interfaces, including serial, DSL, and cable interfaces. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To be available, an interface must be: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Configured with an IP address and a subnet mask </b>- Use the<b> ip address</b><i> ip-address subnet-mask </i>interface configuration command.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Activated </b>- By default, LAN and WAN interfaces are not activated (<b>shutdown</b>). To enable an interface, it must be activated using the<b> no shutdown </b>command. (This is similar to powering on the interface.) The interface must also be connected to another device (a hub, a switch, or another router) for the physical layer to be active.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Optionally, the interface could also be configured with a short description of up to 240 characters. It is good practice to configure a description on each interface. On production networks, the benefits of interface descriptions are quickly realized as they are helpful in troubleshooting and to identify a third party connection and contact information.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Depending on the type of interface, additional parameters may be required. For example, in the lab environment, the serial interface connecting to the serial cable end labeled DCE must be configured with the<b> clock rate </b>command. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Accidentally using the<b> clock rate </b>command on a DTE interface generates a “%Error: This command applies only to DCE interface” informational message.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figures 1 through 3 provide examples of configuring the router interfaces of R1. In Figure 3, notice that the state of Serial0/0/0 is “down”. The status will change to “up” when the Serial0/0/0 interface on R2 is configured and activated.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 4 to configure router R2.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows the commands used to configure a description on an interface.  The commands begin from global configuration mode.  The first command moves to interface configuration mode and it is interface gigabit ethernet zero slash zero.  The next command configures the description and it is description Link to LAN 1.  The text after the word description becomes the description.  The next command in the figure assigns an I.P. address on the interface and it is i.p. address 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 1 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 0.  The interface is turned on with the command no shutdown. Figure two configures a description and an i.p. address on the gigabit Ethernet zero slash one port.  The commands begin in global configuration mode.  The first command moves to interface configuration mode and it is interface gigabit ethernet zero slash one.  The next command configures the description and it is description Link to LAN 2.  The next command in the figure assigns an I.P. address on the interface and it is i.p. address 192 dot 168 dot 11 dot 1 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 0.  The interface is turned on with the command no shutdown. Figure three configures a serial interface and begins in global configuration mode.  The first command moves to interface configuration mode and it is interface serial zero slash zero slash zero.  The next command configures the description and it is description Link to R2.  The next command in the figure assigns an I.P. address on the interface and it is i.p. address 209 dot 165 dot 200 dot 225 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 252.  The next command configures a clock rate on the serial interface, and the command is clock rate 128,000.  The interface is turned on with the command no shutdown. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure the I.P. address, add a description, and activate an interface on a router.</div>
