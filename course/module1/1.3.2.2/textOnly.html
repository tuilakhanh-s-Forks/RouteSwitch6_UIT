          <p>An active, properly configured, directly connected interface actually creates two routing table entries. The figure displays the IPv4 routing table entries on R1 for the directly connected network 192.168.10.0. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The routing table entry for directly connected interfaces is simpler than the entries for remote networks. The entries contain the following information:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Route source </b>- Identifies how the route was learned. Directly connected interfaces have two route source codes. ‘<b>C</b>’ identifies a directly connected network. ’<b>L</b>’ identifies the IPv4 address assigned to the router’s interface.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Destination network </b>- The address of the remote network.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Outgoing interface </b>- Identifies the exit interface to use when forwarding packets to the destination network.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Prior to IOS 15, local route routing table entries (<b>L</b>) were not displayed in the IPv4 routing table. Local route (<b>L</b>) entries have always been a part of the IPv6 routing table.</p>
