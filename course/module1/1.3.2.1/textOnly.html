          <p>A newly deployed router, without any configured interfaces, has an empty routing table, as shown in the figure.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Before the interface state is considered up/up and added to the IPv4 routing table, the interface must:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Be assigned a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Be activated with the<b> no shutdown </b>command</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Receive a carrier signal from another device (router, switch, host, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When the interface is up, the network of that interface is added to the routing table as a directly connected network.</p>
