          <p>Cisco routers and Cisco switches have many similarities. They support a similar modal operating system, similar command structures, and many of the same commands. In addition, both devices have similar initial configuration steps. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For instance, the following configuration tasks should always be performed:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Name the device </b>– (Figure 1) Distinguishes it from other routers.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Secure management access </b>– (Figure 2) Secures privileged EXEC, user EXEC, and remote access.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Configure a banner </b>– (Figure 3) Provides legal notification of unauthorized access.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Always save the changes on a router as shown in Figure 4 and verify the basic configuration and router operations. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 5 to configure router R2.</p>
