        <h1>The Routing Table</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The routing table of a router stores information about:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Directly connected routes </b>- These routes come from the active router interfaces. Routers add a directly connected route when an interface is configured with an IP address and is activated. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Remote routes </b>- These are remote networks connected to other routers. Routes to these networks can either be statically configured or dynamically learned through dynamic routing protocols. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Specifically, a routing table is a data file in RAM that is used to store route information about directly connected and remote networks. The routing table contains network or next hop associations. These associations tell a router that a particular destination can be optimally reached by sending the packet to a specific router that represents the next hop on the way to the final destination. The next hop association can also be the outgoing or exit interface to the next destination. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The figure identifies the directly connected networks and remote networks of router R1.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows two routers connected together through a WAN serial link.  Each router has two local networks connected to LAN interfaces.  Any network that is assigned to a routerâ€™s local interface is considered a directly connected network and all networks that are connected to other routers are considered remote networks.</div>
