            <b>Scenario</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Ashland and Richmond routing tables shown in the file provided with this activity. </p>
          <p>With the help of a classmate, draw a network topology using the information from the tables.  </p>
          <p>To assist you with this activity, follow these guidelines:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Start with the Ashland router</b> - use its routing table to identify ports and IP addresses/networks.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Add the Richmond router</b> - use its routing table to identify ports and IP addresses/networks.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Add any other intermediary and end devices as specified by the tables.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>In addition, record answers from your group to the reflection questions provided with this activity.</p>
          <p>Be prepared to share your work with another group and/or the class.</p>
