          <p>Most network capable devices (e.g.., computers, tablets, and smartphones) require the following components to operate, as shown in Figure 1:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Central processing unit (CPU)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Operating system (OS)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Memory and storage (RAM, ROM, NVRAM, Flash, hard drive)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A router is essentially a specialized computer. It requires a CPU and memory to temporarily and permanently store data to execute operating system instructions, such as system initialization, routing functions, and switching functions. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Cisco devices use the Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) as the system software.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Router memory is classified as volatile or non-volatile. Volatile memory loses its content when the power is turned off, while non-volatile memory does not lose its content when the power is turned off. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The table in Figure 2 summarizes the types of router memory, the volatility, and examples of what is stored in each. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Unlike a computer, a router does not have video adapters or sound card adapters. Instead, routers have specialized ports and network interface cards to interconnect devices to other networks. Figure 3 identifies some of these ports and interfaces.</p>
