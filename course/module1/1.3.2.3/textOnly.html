          <p>The examples in Figures 1 to 3 show the steps to configure and activate the interfaces attached to R1. Notice the Layer 1 and 2 informational messages generated as each interface is activated.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As each interface is added, the routing table automatically adds the connected (‘<b>C</b>’) and local (‘<b>L</b>’) entries. Figure 4 provides an example of the routing table with the directly connected interfaces of R1 configured and activated.</p>
          <p></p>
