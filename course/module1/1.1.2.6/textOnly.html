          <p>In a production environment, infrastructure devices are commonly accessed remotely using Secure Shell (SSH) or HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). Console access is really only required when initially configuring a device, or if remote access fails.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Console access requires:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Console cable </b>- RJ-45-to-DB-9 serial cable or a USB serial cable</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Terminal emulation software </b>- Tera Term, PuTTY, HyperTerminal </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The cable is connected between the serial port of the host and the console port on the device. Most computers and notebooks no longer include built-in serial ports. If the host does not have a serial port, the USB port can be used to establish a console connection. A special USB-to-RS-232 compatible serial port adapter is required when using the USB port. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Cisco ISR G2 supports a USB serial console connection. To establish connectivity, a USB Type-A to USB Type-B (mini-B USB) is required, as well as an operating system device driver. This device driver is available from <a href="http://www.cisco.com/" target="_blank">www.cisco.com</a>. Although these routers have two console ports, only one console port can be active at a time. When a cable is plugged into the USB console port, the RJ-45 port becomes inactive. When the USB cable is removed from the USB port, the RJ-45 port becomes active.</p>

          <p>The table in Figure 1 summarizes the console connection requirements. Figure 2 displays the various ports and cables required.</p>
