          <p>Network infrastructure devices require IP addresses to enable remote management. Using the device IP address, the network administrator can remotely connect to the device using Telnet, SSH, HTTP, or HTTPS.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A switch does not have a dedicated interface to which an IP address can be assigned. Instead, the IP address information is configured on a virtual interface called a switched virtual interface (SVI). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For example, in Figure 1, the SVI on the Layer 2 switch S1 is assigned the IP address 192.168.10.2/24 and a default gateway of 192.168.10.1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 2 to configure the Layer 2 switch S2.</p>
