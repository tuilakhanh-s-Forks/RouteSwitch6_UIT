          <p>The command history feature is useful, because it temporarily stores the list of executed commands to be recalled. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To recall commands in the history buffer, press<b> Ctrl</b>+<b>P </b>or the<b> Up Arrow </b>key. The command output begins with the most recent command. Repeat the key sequence to recall successively older commands. To return to more recent commands in the history buffer, press <b>Ctrl</b>+<b>N</b> or the <b>Down Arrow</b> key. Repeat the key sequence to recall successively more recent commands.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>By default, command history is enabled and the system captures the last 10 command lines in its history buffer. Use the<b> show history </b>privileged EXEC command to display the contents of the buffer.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It is also practical to increase the number of command lines that the history buffer records during the current terminal session only. Use the<b> terminal history size </b>user EXEC command to increase or decrease the size of the buffer.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 displays a sample of the<b> terminal history size </b>and<b> show history </b>commands.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 2 to practice the two EXEC commands.</p>
