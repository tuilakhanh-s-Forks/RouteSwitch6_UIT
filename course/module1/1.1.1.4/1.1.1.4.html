        <h1>Routers Interconnect Networks</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Most users are unaware of the presence of numerous routers on their own network or on the Internet. Users expect to be able to access web pages, send emails, and download music, regardless of whether the server accessed is on their own network or on another network. Networking professionals know that it is the router that is responsible for forwarding packets from network to network, from the original source to the final destination.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A router connects multiple networks, which means that it has multiple interfaces that each belong to a different IP network. When a router receives an IP packet on one interface, it determines which interface to use to forward the packet to the destination. The interface that the router uses to forward the packet may be the final destination, or it may be a network connected to another router that is used to reach the destination network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the animation in Figure 1, R1 and R2 are responsible for receiving the packet on one network and forwarding the packet out another network toward the destination network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Each network that a router connects to typically requires a separate interface. These interfaces are used to connect a combination of both local-area networks (LANs) and wide-area networks (WANs). LANs are commonly Ethernet networks that contain devices, such as PCs, printers, and servers. WANs are used to connect networks over a large geographical area. For example, a WAN connection is commonly used to connect a LAN to the Internet service provider (ISP) network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Notice that each site in Figure 2 requires the use of a router to interconnect to other sites. Even the Home Office requires a router. In this topology, the router located at the Home Office is a specialized device that performs multiple services for the home network.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows two LANs. Each LAN has a router. The LANs are connected to each other by a WAN link. Each router has a switch connected to an Ethernet port, and each switch has multiple local devices connected to it.  An animation shows a packet being sent from a computer on one LAN to a computer on the other LAN.  The packet travels to the switch and then to the router, which transfers the packet to the serial port and sends it to the other router.  This router receives the packet on the serial interface and transfers it to its Ethernet interface.  The packet is then sent to the switch, which sends it to the destination device. Figure two shows three LANs that are all interconnected through WAN connections.</div>
