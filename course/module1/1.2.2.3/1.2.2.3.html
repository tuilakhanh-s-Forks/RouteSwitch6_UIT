        <h1>Load Balancing</h1>
        <div>
          <p>What happens if a routing table has two or more paths with identical metrics to the same destination network? </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When a router has two or more paths to a destination with equal cost metrics, then the router forwards the packets using both paths equally. This is called equal cost load balancing. The routing table contains the single destination network, but has multiple exit interfaces, one for each equal cost path. The router forwards packets using the multiple exit interfaces listed in the routing table. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If configured correctly, load balancing can increase the effectiveness and performance of the network. Equal cost load balancing can be configured to use both dynamic routing protocols and static routes. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Only EIGRP supports unequal cost load balancing.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The animation in the figure provides an example of equal cost load balancing.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure is an animation of equal cost load balancing done by routers.  The network shown has four routers connected in a square pattern with each router at a corner and a single link on each of the four sides.  A computer connected to the router at the top left corner sends data to a computer connected at the bottom right corner.  Being a square gives two paths for the data, and with equal load balancing, about half of the data will be sent across each of the two paths.</div>
