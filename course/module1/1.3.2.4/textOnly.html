          <p>The example in Figure 1 shows the configuration steps for the directly connected interfaces of R1 with the indicated IPv6 addresses. Notice the Layer 1 and Layer 2 informational messages generated as each interface is configured and activated.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The <b>show ipv6 route</b> command shown in Figure 2 is used to verify that IPv6 networks and specific IPv6 interface addresses have been installed in the IPv6 routing table. Like IPv4, a ‘<b>C</b>’ next to a route indicates that this is a directly connected network. An ‘<b>L</b>’ indicates the local route. In an IPv6 network, the local route has a /128 prefix. Local routes are used by the routing table to efficiently process packets with a destination address of the interface of the router. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Notice that there is also a route installed to the FF00::/8 network. This route is required for multicast routing.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 3 displays how the<b> show ipv6 route </b>command can be combined with a specific network destination to display the details of how that route was learned by the router. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 4 displays how connectivity to R2 can be verified using the <b>ping</b> command. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 5, notice what happens when the G0/0 LAN interface of R2 is the target of the <b>ping</b> command. The pings are unsuccessful. This is because R1 does not have an entry in the routing table to reach the 2001:DB8:ACAD:4::/64 network. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>R1 requires additional information to reach a remote network. Remote network route entries can be added to the routing table using either:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Static routing </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Dynamic routing protocols</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
