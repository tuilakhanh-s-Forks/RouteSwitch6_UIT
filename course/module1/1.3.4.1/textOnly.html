          <p>Dynamic routing protocols are used by routers to share information about the reachability and status of remote networks. Dynamic routing protocols perform several activities, including network discovery and maintaining routing tables.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Network discovery is the ability of a routing protocol to share information about the networks that it knows about with other routers that are also using the same routing protocol. Instead of depending on manually configured static routes to remote networks on every router, a dynamic routing protocol allows the routers to automatically learn about these networks from other routers. These networks, and the best path to each, are added to the routing table of the router, and identified as a network learned by a specific dynamic routing protocol.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>During network discovery, routers exchange routes and update their routing tables. Routers have converged after they have finished exchanging and updating their routing tables. Routers then maintain the networks in their routing tables. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The figure provides a simple scenario of how two neighboring routers would initially exchange routing information. In this simplified exchange, R1 introduces itself and the networks it can reach. R2 responds with its list of networks.</p>
