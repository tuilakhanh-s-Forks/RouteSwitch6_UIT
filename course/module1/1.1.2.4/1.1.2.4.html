        <h1>Enable IP on a Host</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A host can be assigned IP address information either:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Statically </b>- The host is manually assigned the correct IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. The DNS server IP address can also be configured.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Dynamically </b>- IP address information is provided by a server using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). The DHCP server provides a valid IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway for end devices. Other information may be provided by the server.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 and Figure 2 provide static and dynamic IPv4 address configuration examples. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Statically assigned addresses are commonly used to identify specific network resources, such as network servers and printers. They can also be used in smaller networks with few hosts. However, most host devices acquire their IPv4 address information by accessing a DHCPv4 server. In large enterprises, dedicated DHCPv4 servers providing services to many LANs are implemented. In a smaller branch or small office setting, DHCPv4 services can be provided by a Cisco Catalyst switch or a Cisco ISR. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows the Windows applet for the local area network connection. The Internet Protocol option is selected.  In the figure, the setting for the I.P. address is statically assigned along with the subnet mask and the default gateway. Figure two shows the address option being set to automatically obtain the I.P. address and the D.N.S. server.</div>
