        <h1>Configure an IPv6 Router Interface</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Configuring an IPv6 interface is similar to configuring an interface for IPv4. Most IPv6 configuration and verification commands in the Cisco IOS are very similar to their IPv4 counterparts. In many cases, the only difference is the use of<b> ipv6</b> in place of<b> ip </b>in commands.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An IPv6 interface must be: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Configured with IPv6 address and subnet mask </b>- Use the<b> ipv6 address </b><i>ipv6-address</i>/<i>prefix-length </i><b>[link-local | eui-64] </b>interface configuration command.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Activated </b>- The interface must be activated using the<b> no shutdown </b>command.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: An interface can generate its own IPv6 link-local address without having a global unicast address by using the<b> ipv6 enable </b>interface configuration command. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Unlike IPv4, IPv6 interfaces will typically have more than one IPv6 address. At a minimum, an IPv6 device must have an IPv6 link-local address but will most likely also have an IPv6 global unicast address. IPv6 also supports the ability for an interface to have multiple IPv6 global unicast addresses from the same subnet. The following commands can be used to statically create a global unicast or link-local IPv6 address:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>ipv6 address </b>
                <i>ipv6-address</i>/<i>prefix-length </i>- Creates a global unicast IPv6 address as specified.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>ipv6 address </b>
                <i>ipv6-address</i>/<i>prefix-length </i><b>eui-64 </b>- Configures a global unicast IPv6 address with an interface identifier (ID) in the low-order 64 bits of the IPv6 address using the EUI-64 process. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>ipv6 address </b>
                <i>ipv6-address</i>/<i>prefix-length </i><b>link-local </b>- Configures a static link-local address on the interface that is used instead of the link-local address that is automatically configured when the global unicast IPv6 address is assigned to the interface or enabled using the <b>ipv6 enable</b> interface command. Recall, the <b>ipv6 enable</b> interface command is used to automatically create an IPv6 link-local address whether or not an IPv6 global unicast address has been assigned.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the example topology shown in Figure 1, R1 must be configured to support the following IPv6 network addresses: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>2001:0DB8:ACAD:0001:/64 or equivalently 2001:DB8:ACAD:1::/64</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>2001:0DB8:ACAD:0002:/64 or equivalently 2001:DB8:ACAD:2::/64</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>2001:0DB8:ACAD:0003:/64 or equivalently 2001:DB8:ACAD:3::/64</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When the router is configured using the<b> ipv6 unicast-routing </b>global configuration command, the router begins sending ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages out the interface. This enables a PC connected to the interface to automatically configure an IPv6 address and to set a default gateway without needing the services of a DHCPv6 server. Alternatively, a PC connected to the IPv6 network can have an IPv6 address manually configured, as shown in Figure 2. Notice that the default gateway address configured for PC1 is the IPv6 global unicast address of the R1 GigabitEthernet 0/0 interface.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The router interfaces in the example topology must be configured and enabled as shown in Figures 3 through 5. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 6 to configure the IPv6 global unicast addresses on router R2.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows a network consisting of one router with a serial interface connecting to the Internet, and two local gigabit Ethernet interfaces configured with a local network. All networks are I.P.v.6. addresses. Figure two shows the Windows applet for statically assigning an I.P.v.6 address on a computer. Figure three shows the router I.O.S. C.L.I. commands for configuring I.P.v.6 on an interface.  The commands begin in global configuration mode.  The first command moves to interface configuration mode, and it is interface gigabit ethernet zero slash zero.  The next command configures the description, and it is description Link to LAN 1.  The next command in the figure assigns an I.P. address on the interface, and it is i.p.v.6 address 2 0 0 1 colon d b 8 colon a c a d colon 1 colon colon 1 slash 64.  The interface is turned on with the command no shutdown. Figure four configures the next interface, and begins in global configuration mode.  The first command moves to interface configuration mode, and it is interface gigabit ethernet zero slash one.  The next command configures the description, and it is description Link to LAN 2.  The next command in the figure assigns an I.P. address on the interface, and it is i.p.v.6 address 2 0 0 1 colon d b 8 colon a c a d colon 2 colon colon 1 slash 64.  The interface is turned on with the command no shutdown. Figure five configures the next interface, and begins in global configuration mode.  The command is interface serial zero slash zero slash zero.  The next command configures the description, and it is description Link to R2.  The next command in the figure assigns an I.P. address on the interface, and it is i.p. address 2 0 0 1 colon d b 8 colon a c a d colon 3 colon colon 1 slash 64.  The next command configures a clock rate on the serial interface, and the command is clock rate 128,000.  The interface is turned on with the command no shutdown. Figure six is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure and activate three interfaces on a router.</div>
