          <p>On a Cisco router, the<b> show ip route</b> command can be used to display the IPv4 routing table of a router. A router provides additional route information, including how the route was learned, how long the route has been in the table, and which specific interface to use to get to a predefined destination.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Entries in the routing table can be added as:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Local Route interfaces </b>- Added when an interface is configured and active. This entry is only displayed in IOS 15 or newer for IPv4 routes and all IOS releases for IPv6 routes.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Directly connected interfaces </b>- Added to the routing table when an interface is configured and active.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Static routes </b>- Added when a route is manually configured and the exit interface is active. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Dynamic routing protocol </b>- Added when routing protocols that dynamically learn about the network, such as EIGRP or OSPF, are implemented and networks are identified.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The sources of the routing table entries are identified by a code. The code identifies how the route was learned. For instance, common codes include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>L </b>- Identifies the address assigned to a routerâ€™s interface. This allows the router to efficiently determine when it receives a packet for the interface instead of being forwarded.  </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>C </b>- Identifies a directly connected network. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>S </b>- Identifies a static route created to reach a specific network. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>D </b>- Identifies a dynamically learned network from another router using EIGRP.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>O </b>- Identifies a dynamically learned network from another router using the OSPF routing protocol.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
