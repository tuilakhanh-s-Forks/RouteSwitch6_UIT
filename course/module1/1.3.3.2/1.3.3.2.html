        <h1>Static Route Examples</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Figure 1 shows the configuration of an IPv4 default static route on R1 to the Serial 0/0/0 interface. Notice that the configuration of the route generated an ‘<span class="cmd">S*</span>’ entry in the routing table. The ‘<span class="cmd">S</span>’ signifies that the route source is a static route while the asterisk (<b>*</b>) identifies this route as a possible candidate to be the default route. In fact, it has been chosen as the default route as evidenced by the line that reads, “Gateway of Last Resort is 0.0.0.0 to network 0.0.0.0.” </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows the configuration of two static routes from R2 to reach the two LANs on R1. The route to 192.168.10.0/24 has been configured using the exit interface while the route to 192.168.11.0/24 has been configured using the next hop IPv4 address. Although both are acceptable, there are some differences in how they operate. For instance, notice how different they look in the routing table. Also notice that because these static routes were to specific networks, the output indicates that the Gateway of Last Resort is not set.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Static and default static routes are discussed in detail in the next chapter.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 3 to configure a default static route on router R1 going to R2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 4 to configure static routes on router R2 to reach the R1 LANs.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows the configuration of an I.P. v 4 default static route on a router.  The command is i.p. route zero dot zero dot zero dot zero dot zero dot zero dot zero dot zero dot serial 0 slash 0 slash 0.  This is configuring the interface as the exit interface for the route.  The figure then shows the output of the show i.p. route pipe begin Gateway command.  This displays the entire routing table and it includes the static default route. Figure two shows the configuration of two static routes on the second router to reach the two LANs on the first router.  The first static route command is i.p. route 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 0 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 0 s 0 slash 0 slash 0.  The second static route command is i.p. route 192 dot 168 dot 11 dot 0 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 0 209 dot 165 dot 200 dot 225.  The figure then shows the output from the show i.p. route pipe begin gateway command, which displays the entire routing table and it includes the static default route. Figure three is an interactive media element that allows the learner to configure a default static route on a router using the next hop i.p. address. Figure four is an interactive media element that allows the learner to configure a static route on a router using the next hop i.p. address.</div>
