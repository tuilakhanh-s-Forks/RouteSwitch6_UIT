          <p>Figure 1 shows the configuration of an IPv4 default static route on R1 to the Serial 0/0/0 interface. Notice that the configuration of the route generated an ‘<span class="cmd">S*</span>’ entry in the routing table. The ‘<span class="cmd">S</span>’ signifies that the route source is a static route while the asterisk (<b>*</b>) identifies this route as a possible candidate to be the default route. In fact, it has been chosen as the default route as evidenced by the line that reads, “Gateway of Last Resort is 0.0.0.0 to network 0.0.0.0.” </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows the configuration of two static routes from R2 to reach the two LANs on R1. The route to 192.168.10.0/24 has been configured using the exit interface while the route to 192.168.11.0/24 has been configured using the next hop IPv4 address. Although both are acceptable, there are some differences in how they operate. For instance, notice how different they look in the routing table. Also notice that because these static routes were to specific networks, the output indicates that the Gateway of Last Resort is not set.</p>
