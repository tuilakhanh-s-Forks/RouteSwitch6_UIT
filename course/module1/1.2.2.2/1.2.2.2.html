        <h1>Best Path</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Determining the best path involves the evaluation of multiple paths to the same destination network and selecting the optimum or shortest path to reach that network. Whenever multiple paths to the same network exist, each path uses a different exit interface on the router to reach that network. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The best path is selected by a routing protocol based on the value or metric it uses to determine the distance to reach a network. A metric is the quantitative value used to measure the distance to a given network. The best path to a network is the path with the lowest metric.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Dynamic routing protocols typically use their own rules and metrics to build and update routing tables. The routing algorithm generates a value, or a metric, for each path through the network. Metrics can be based on either a single characteristic or several characteristics of a path. Some routing protocols can base route selection on multiple metrics, combining them into a single metric. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The following lists some dynamic protocols and the metrics they use:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Routing Information Protocol (RIP) </b>- Hop count</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) </b>- Ciscoâ€™s cost based on cumulative bandwidth from source to destination</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) </b>- Bandwidth, delay, load, reliability</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The animation in the figure highlights how the path may be different depending on the metric being used. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure is an animation showing the difference between hop count and bandwidth as a routing metric.  The figure shows a computer sending a data packet to a destination computer and there are three routers that are forming a full mesh, which gives two potential paths for the data.  One route is using a 56 K.b.p.s. line and utilizes one router.  The other path has two routers, and each link is a T-1 link of 1.544 mega b.p.s.  When using hop count as the metric, the packet will travel the first path through one router.  When using bandwidth as the metric, the packet will follow the two T-1 links because the two T-1 links is a faster path than the one 56 k.b.p.s. link.</div>
