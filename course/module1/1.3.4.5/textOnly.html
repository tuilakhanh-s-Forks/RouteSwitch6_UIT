          <p>Routers R1 and R2 have been configured with the dynamic routing protocol EIGRP for IPv6. (This is the IPv6 equivalent of EIGRP for IPv4.)</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To view the routing table on R1, enter the<b> show ipv6 route </b>command, as shown in the figure. The output in the figure displays the routing table of R1 after the routers have exchanged updates and converged. Along with the connected and local routes, there are two ‘<b>D</b>’ entries (EIGRP routes) in the routing table. </p>
