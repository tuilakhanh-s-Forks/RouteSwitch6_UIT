          <p>In this dynamic routing example, assume that R1 and R2 have been configured to support the dynamic routing protocol EIGRP. The routers also advertise directly connected networks. R2 advertises that it is the default gateway to other networks. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The output in the figure displays the routing table of R1 after the routers have exchanged updates and converged. Along with the connected and link local interfaces, there are three ‘<b>D</b>’ entries in the routing table. </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The entry beginning with ‘<b>D*EX</b>’ identifies that the source of this entry was EIGRP (‘<b>D</b>’). The route is a candidate to be a default route (‘<b>*</b>’), and the route is an external route (‘*<b>EX</b>’) forwarded by EIGRP. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The other two ‘<b>D</b>’ entries are routes installed in the routing table based on the update from R2 advertising its LANs.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
