          <p>In IPv4 configured networks, clients and servers use private addressing. Before packets with private addressing can cross then Internet, they need to be translated to public addressing. Servers that are accessed from outside the organization are usually assigned both a public and a private static IPv4 address. In this activity, you will configure static NAT so that outside devices can access and inside server at its public address.</p>
