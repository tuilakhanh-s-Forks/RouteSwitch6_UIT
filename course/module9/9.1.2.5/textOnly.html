          <p>Summarizing the differences between NAT and PAT helps your understanding of each. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As the figure shows, NAT translates IPv4 addresses on a 1:1 basis between private IPv4 addresses and public IPv4 addresses. However, PAT modifies both the address and the port number. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>NAT forwards incoming packets to their inside destination by referring to the incoming source IPv4 address given by the host on the public network. With PAT, there is generally only one or a very few publicly exposed IPv4 addresses. Incoming packets from the public network are routed to their destinations on the private network by referring to a table in the NAT router. This table tracks public and private port pairs. This is called connection tracking.</p>

            <b>Packets without a Layer 4 Segment</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>What about IPv4 packets carrying data other than a TCP or UDP segment? These packets do not contain a Layer 4 port number. PAT translates most common protocols carried by IPv4 that do not use TCP or UDP as a transport layer protocol. The most common of these is ICMPv4. Each of these types of protocols is handled differently by PAT. For example, ICMPv4 query messages, echo requests, and echo replies include a Query ID. ICMPv4 uses the Query ID to identify an echo request with its corresponding echo reply. The Query ID is incremented with each echo request sent. PAT uses the Query ID instead of a Layer 4 port number. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Other ICMPv4 messages do not use the Query ID. These messages and other protocols that do not use TCP or UDP port numbers vary and are beyond the scope of this curriculum.</p>
