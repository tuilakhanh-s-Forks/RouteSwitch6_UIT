          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1. </b>Define the pool of addresses that will be used for translation using the <b>ip nat pool</b> command. This pool of addresses is typically a group of public addresses. The addresses are defined by indicating the starting IPv4 address and the ending IPv4 address of the pool. The <b>netmask</b> or <b>prefix-length</b> keyword indicates which address bits belong to the network and which bits belong to the host for the range of addresses. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2. </b>Configure a standard ACL to identify (permit) only those addresses that are to be translated. An ACL that is too permissive can lead to unpredictable results. Remember there is an implicit <b>deny all</b> statement at the end of each ACL.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3. </b>Bind the ACL to the pool. The<b> ip nat inside source list </b><i>access-list-number </i><b>pool </b><i>pool name </i>command is used to bind the ACL to the pool. This configuration is used by the router to identify which devices (<b>list</b>) receive which addresses (<b>pool</b>).</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4. </b>Identify which interfaces are inside, in relation to NAT; that is, any interface that connects to the inside network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5.</b> Identify which interfaces are outside, in relation to NAT; that is, any interface that connects to the outside network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows an example topology and configuration. This configuration allows translation for all hosts on the 192.168.0.0/16 network, which includes the 192.168.10.0 and 192.168.11.0 LANs, when they generate traffic that enters S0/0/0 and exits S0/1/0. These hosts are translated to an available address in the pool in the range 209.165.200.226 - 209.165.200.240.</p>

          <p>Figure 3 shows the topology used for the Syntax Checker configuration. Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 4 to configure dynamic NAT on R2. </p>
