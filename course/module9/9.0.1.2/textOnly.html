            <b>Scenario</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>You work for a large university or school system. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Because you are the network administrator, many professors, administrative workers, and other network administrators need your assistance with their networks on a daily basis. They call you at all working hours of the day and, because of the number of telephone calls, you cannot complete your regular network administration tasks.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>You need to find a way to limit when you take calls and from whom.  You also need to mask your telephone number so that when you call someone, another number is displayed to the recipient.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This scenario describes a very common problem for most small- to medium-sized businesses.
