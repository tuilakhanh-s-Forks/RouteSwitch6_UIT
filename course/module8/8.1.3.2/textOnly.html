          <p>For example, the figure shows the default WAN setup page for a Packet Tracer wireless router. Notice that the Internet connection type is set to <b>Automatic Configuration - DHCP</b>. This selection is used when the router is connected to a DSL or cable modem and acts as a DHCPv4 client, requesting an IPv4 address from the ISP. </p>
