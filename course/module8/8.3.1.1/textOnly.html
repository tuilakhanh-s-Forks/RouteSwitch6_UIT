            <b>IoE and DHCP</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This chapter presents the concept of using the DHCP process in a small- to medium-sized business network; however, DHCP also has other uses!  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>With the advent of the Internet of Everything (IoE), any device in your home capable of wired or wireless connectivity to a network will be able to be accessed from just about anywhere.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Using Packet Tracer for this modeling activity, perform the following tasks:  </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Configure a Cisco 1941 router (or DHCP-server-capable ISR device) for IPv4 or IPv6 DHCP addressing.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Think of five devices in your home you would like to receive IP addresses from the routerâ€™s DHCP service.  Set the end devices to claim DHCP addresses from the DHCP server.  </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Show output validating that each end device secures an IP address from the server. Save your output information via a screen capture program or use the <b>PrtScrn </b>key command.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Present your findings to a fellow classmate or to the class.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
