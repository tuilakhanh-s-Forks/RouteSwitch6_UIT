          <p>Although DHCPv6 is similar to DHCPv4 in what it provides, the two protocols are independent of each other. DHCPv6 is defined in RFC 3315. There has been a lot of work done on this specification over the years as indicated by the fact that DHCPv6 RFC has the highest revision number of any Internet draft. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Stateless DHCPv6 Option (Router Advertisement and DHCPv6)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The stateless DHCPv6 option informs the client to use the information in the RA message for addressing, but additional configuration parameters are available from a DHCPv6 server. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Using the prefix and prefix length in the RA message, along with EUI-64 or a randomly generated IID, the client creates its IPv6 global unicast address.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The client will then communicate with a stateless DHCPv6 server to obtain additional information not provided in the RA message. This may be a list of DNS server IPv6 addresses, for example. This process is known as stateless DHCPv6 because the server is not maintaining any client state information (i.e., a list of available and allocated IPv6 addresses). The stateless DHCPv6 server is only providing configuration parameters for clients, not IPv6 addresses.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For stateless DHCPv6, the O flag is set to 1 and the M flag is left at the default setting of 0. The O flag value of 1 is used to inform the client that additional configuration information is available from a stateless DHCPv6 server. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To modify the RA message sent on the interface of a router to indicate stateless DHCPv6, use the following command:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <span class="cmd">Router(config-if)# </span>
            <span class="cmd">
              <b>ipv6 nd other-config-flag</b>
            </span>
            <span class="cmd"></span>
          </p>
