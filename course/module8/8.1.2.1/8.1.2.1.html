        <h1>Configuring a Basic DHCPv4 Server</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A Cisco router running Cisco IOS software can be configured to act as a DHCPv4 server. The Cisco IOS DHCPv4 server assigns and manages IPv4 addresses from specified address pools within the router to DHCPv4 clients. The topology shown in Figure 1 is used to illustrate this functionality.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1. Excluding IPv4 Addresses</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The router functioning as the DHCPv4 server assigns all IPv4 addresses in a DHCPv4 address pool unless configured to exclude specific addresses. Typically, some IPv4 addresses in a pool are assigned to network devices that require static address assignments. Therefore, these IPv4 addresses should not be assigned to other devices. To exclude specific addresses, use the <b>ip dhcp excluded-address</b> command as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A single address or a range of addresses can be excluded by specifying the low-address and high-address of the range. Excluded addresses should include the addresses assigned to routers, servers, printers, and other devices that have been or will be manually configured.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2. Configuring a DHCPv4 Pool</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Configuring a DHCPv4 server involves defining a pool of addresses to assign. As shown in Figure 3, the <b>ip dhcp pool </b><i>pool-name</i> command creates a pool with the specified name and puts the router in DHCPv4 configuration mode, which is identified by this prompt Router(dhcp-config)#.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3. Configuring Specific Tasks</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 4 lists the tasks to complete the DHCPv4 pool configuration. Some of these are optional, while others must be configured. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The address pool and default gateway router must be configured. Use the <b>network</b> statement to define the range of available addresses. </p>
          <p>Use the <b>default-router</b> command to define the default gateway router. Typically, the gateway is the LAN interface of the router closest to the client devices. One gateway is required, but you can list up to eight addresses if there are multiple gateways.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Other DHCPv4 pool commands are optional. For example, the IPv4 address of the DNS server that is available to a DHCPv4 client is configured using the <b>dns-server</b> command. The <b>domain-name </b><i>domain</i> command is used to define the domain name. The duration of the DHCPv4 lease can be changed using the <b>lease</b> command. The default lease value is one day. The <b>netbios-name-server</b> command is used to define the NetBIOS WINS server.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>DHCPv4 Example</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A sample configuration with basic DHCPv4 parameters configured on router R1 is shown in Figure 5. R1 is configured as a DHCPv4 server for the 192.168.10.0/24 LAN using the example topology from Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Disabling DHCPv4</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The DHCPv4 service is enabled, by default. To disable the service, use the <b>no service dhcp</b> global configuration mode command. Use the <b>service dhcp</b> global configuration mode command to re-enable the DHCPv4 server process. Enabling the service has no effect if the parameters are not configured.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker activity in Figure 6 to configure similar DHCPv4 parameters on R1 for the 192.168.11.0/24 LAN.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows a network topology of three routers.  R-2 is in the middle and has a serial WAN link to R-1 and a serial WAN link to R-3.  R-1 and R-3 are not directly connected.  R-1 has two active gigabit Ethernet LANs. Each of these LANs has a switch connected to them, and each switch is connected to a computer. There is also a d.h.c.p. server connected to S-2.  R-3 has one active gigabit Ethernet LAN, which contains a switch and a computer. Figure two shows the commands used to exclude specific addresses from a d.h.c.p. pool.  The command is, i.p. d.h.c.p. excluded hyphen address.  This is immediately followed with either the specific address or the address range.  Two examples are listed. The first example lists a range and the command is, i.p. d.h.c.p. excluded hyphen address 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 1 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 9.  The second example lists a single address and the command is, i.p. d.h.c.p. excluded hyphen address 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 254.Figure three shows the command used to create the d.h.c.p. pool. The command is, i.p. d.h.c.p. pool followed by the pool name.  The example is, i.p. d.h.c.p. pool LAN hyphen POOL hyphen 1.Figure four lists two required parameters when configuring d.h.c.p. These two parameters are defining the address pool and defining the default router or gateway.  Optional tasks include defining a d.n.s. server, defining a domain name, setting a d.h.c.p. lease time, and defining a net bios w.i.n.s. server. Figure five continues the d.h.c.p. configuration example.  The next command sets the network range and the command is, network 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot zero.  The next command is, default hyphen router 192 dot 168 11 dot 5.  The d.n.s. server is configured with the command, domain hyphen name example dot com. Figure six is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure a router as a d.h.c.p.v.4. server.</div>
