            <b>SLAAC Option (Router Advertisement only)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>SLAAC is the default option on Cisco routers. Both the M flag and the O flag are set to 0 in the RA, as shown in the figure.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This option instructs the client to use the information in the RA message exclusively. This includes prefix, prefix-length, DNS server, MTU, and default gateway information. There is no further information available from a DHCPv6 server. The IPv6 global unicast address is created by combining the prefix from RA and an Interface ID using either EUI-64 or a randomly generated value. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>RA messages are configured on an individual interface of a router. To re-enable an interface for SLAAC that might have been set to another option, the M and O flags need to be reset to their initial values of 0. This is done using the following interface configuration mode commands: </p>
