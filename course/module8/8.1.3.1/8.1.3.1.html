        <h1>Configuring a Router as DHCPv4 Client</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Sometimes, Cisco routers in small office/home office (SOHO) and branch sites have to be configured as DHCPv4 clients in a similar manner to client computers. The method used depends on the ISP. However, in its simplest configuration, the Ethernet interface is used to connect to a cable or DSL modem. To configure an Ethernet interface as a DHCP client, use the <b>ip address dhcp</b> interface configuration mode command.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 1, assume that an ISP has been configured to provide select customers with IP addresses from the 209.165.201.0/27 network range. After the G0/1 interface is configured with the <b>ip address dhcp</b> command, the <b>show ip interface g0/1</b> command confirms that the interface is up and that the address was allocated by a DHCPv4 server. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 2 to configure the interface that is connected to the ISP to acquire an address from the DHCP server.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows the command used to configure a router to obtain an i.p. address through d.h.c.p.  The command is run from the interface configuration mode and the example begins in global configuration mode.  The first command shown, is interface g zero slash one.  The next command is, i.p. address d.h.c.p.  The figure then shows the output from the command, show i.p. interface g zero slash one. This command lists an i.p. address and a line that states that the address is determined by d.h.c.p. Figure two is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure a router as a d.h.c.p. client.</div>
