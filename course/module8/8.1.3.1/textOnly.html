          <p>Sometimes, Cisco routers in small office/home office (SOHO) and branch sites have to be configured as DHCPv4 clients in a similar manner to client computers. The method used depends on the ISP. However, in its simplest configuration, the Ethernet interface is used to connect to a cable or DSL modem. To configure an Ethernet interface as a DHCP client, use the <b>ip address dhcp</b> interface configuration mode command.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 1, assume that an ISP has been configured to provide select customers with IP addresses from the 209.165.201.0/27 network range. After the G0/1 interface is configured with the <b>ip address dhcp</b> command, the <b>show ip interface g0/1</b> command confirms that the interface is up and that the address was allocated by a DHCPv4 server. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 2 to configure the interface that is connected to the ISP to acquire an address from the DHCP server.</p>
